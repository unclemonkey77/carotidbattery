Part 3:



I drove it up to my Mom and Dad&#8217;s house this afternoon with the motocompy in place and I think it was a success&#8230;a learning success. The screen was pretty wobbly because the hinge had too much play in the joint, if that makes any sense. I think I need to find a slightly larger post for the hinge so that it doesn&#8217;t bounce around quite as much. Not that it really mattered today&#8230;the glare made the screen fairly unusable. Also, the power inverter was giving me some problems. I have two power inverters and the one that I&#8217;m using right now is a higher wattage rating and it has a fan in it but it also likes to cut out at odd times&#8230;so, I think I&#8217;m going to take it out for a spin with the other inverter and see how that works. Overall, I was pretty pleased with how everything worked. The computer stayed in place, nothing caught on fire, and I didn&#8217;t crash. I&#8217;d call it a success.
