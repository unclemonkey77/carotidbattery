 <p>Today proved challenging for me.  I decided to take motocompy out for a spin to make sure everything was working well before the long trip tomorrow.  I&#8217;ve done a lot of work on the system in the last few days, with the help of my brother, Jon, and I wanted to make sure it was ready to go and there were no nasty surprises as I was leaving.  I took motocompy out to the bike, set him down, turned him on, started using things&#8230;started <em>trying</em> to use things&#8230;and found that things weren&#8217;t usable.  My touchscreen, which had worked so well since I had purchased it in November, had chosen the afternoon before my departure to go cold to my touch.  Long story and I&#8217;m not really even sure what all happened&#8230;it was a flurry of driver installs, driver uninstalls, driver reinstalls, system reboots, etc.  Somewhere along the line it decided to work again and as of now I have a working computer with a working touchscreen.  We&#8217;ll see how long that lasts.  So, while on the subject of system components (both working and non-working), I might as well list out some info about the bike, the computer, and what kind of programs I&#8217;m running.  If you&#8217;re not into the technical stuff then you can just skip to the video at the bottom.  I filmed it tonight on a quick trip to ensure the computer was working properly.  Here goes&#8230;</p> <p><strong><u>Bike: </u></strong></p> <ul> <li>2003 Yamaha FJR-1300  (Yamaha calls it a &#8220;Super-Sport Touring&#8221; bike) </li> <li>1300cc, 145hp </li> <li>Mileage at trip start: 7230 </li> <li>Approximate mileage at trip end: 17700</li> </ul> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/172491695/"><img height="75" alt="FJR1300 front" src="http://static.flickr.com/76/172491695\_62ab1c5c6d\_t.jpg" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/172487264/"><img height="100" alt="FJR1300 front" src="http://static.flickr.com/75/17248726 4\_2df40f9581\_t.jpg" width="90" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/172487265/"><img height="75" alt="FJR1300 rear" src="http://static.flickr.com/69/172487265\_9b5e9c8fb5\_t.jpg" width="100" /></a> <p><strong><u>Motocompy:</u></strong></p> <ul> <li>Motherboard: Via MII (Mini-ITX form factor) </li> <li>CPU: embedded 1Ghz </li> <li>Memory: 1GB RAM </li> <li>Hard Drive: 80GB 2.5&#8243; </li> <li>GPS: Holux Slim 236 </li> <li>Webcam: Logitech Fusion </li> <li>External Audio: Creative USB </li> <li>Headphones: Shure E2C </li> <li>Optical Drive: DVD/CD-ROM </li> <li>Touch Screen: 7&#8243; Newision (formerly Lilliput) </li> <li>Inverter: 200Watt cheapo from Target </li> <li>Case: from Solar PC </li> <li>Miscellaneous: Case fan mounted on top, 4-port USB hub, PCMCIA wifi </li> <li>Mobile Connection: Cingular 8125 (aka HTC wizard) </li> </ul> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/172491694/"><img height="75" alt="Webcam" src="http://static.flickr.com/76/172491694\_8badb95d2b\_t.jpg" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/172487267/"><img height="92" alt="Motocompy 1" src="http://static.flickr.com/65/172487267\_1e3932b19e\_t.jpg" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/172487269/"><img height="75" alt="Screen with shade" src="http://static.flickr.com/77/172487269\_9fc5b50b60\_t.jpg" width="100" /></a> <p><u><strong>Software:</strong></u></p> <ul> <li>Primary Navigation: iGuidance (modified for easier use with iGmod) </li> <li>Trip Planning: Microsoft Streets & Trips 2006 </li> <li>Frontend: Centrafuse </li> <li>Video Capture: Capture!
