 <p>Another incredible day.  Incredible, and long, and tiring.  I&#8217;m going to keep this short  because there aren&#8217;t any electrical hookups at the campsite I&#8217;m at, but I wanted to post something small because it was such an amazing day.  I started off in Crescent City and made my way up the 199 through the Jedediah Smith National Redwood Park.  That took me to the Oregon border where I stayed on the 199 until I got to the I-5.  Took that south and then a few smaller roads brought me to the 62 which goes all the way to the lake.  Riding next to the Rogue River in this section was truly an experience.  There&#8217;s one portion where the river travels underground making a natural bridge out of the lava rock.  Crater Lake was spectacular.  I won&#8217;t be able to put it into words so I&#8217;m not going to try.  The roads were clear but there was a ton of snow everywhere else.  I saw a few dear&#8230;came within feet of hitting one&#8230;dodged some thunderstorms and made it down the mountain on the 138.  After a little bit of searching I found a nice camping spot right on the Umpqua River and here I sit on my motorcycle, typing away on this post before heading to bed.  The other campers must think I&#8217;m a weirdo&#8230;that&#8217;s ok, I kindof think the same thing.  The phone connection isn&#8217;t too strong out here so I&#8217;m going to keep it to one picture, but when I get somewhere with a decent wifi signal I&#8217;ll have an uploading bonanza.  Oh, and for everyone that&#8217;s left comments&#8230;thank you.  I haven&#8217;t had a chance to respond just because I&#8217;m riding and posting all day long, but know that it&#8217;s appreciated and that I enjoy your comments.  Thanks.  Ok, and for the picture&#8230;this is me and Crater Lake, standing in a place I shouldn&#8217;t have been.  Good night.</p> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/177494392/"><img alt="Crater Lake" src="http://static.flickr.com/48/177494392_9093540102.jpg" height="180" width="240" /></a>
