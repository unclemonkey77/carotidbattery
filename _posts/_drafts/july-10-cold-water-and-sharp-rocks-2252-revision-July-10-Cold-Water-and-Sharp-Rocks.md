<a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/187124168/"><img style="float: left;" alt="Blue Skies" src="http://static.flickr.com/59/187124168\_a4d3fec907\_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> <p>I wish I could stay up late and write for a long time, but it&#8217;s already later than I should be up and I have a long ride tomorrow.  Long and short of it is this:  I got to Coldfoot yesterday eveni ng after a long, sometimes harrowing ride through anything and everthing (mud was my favorite), camped there, got up this morning and road (again, through anything and everything) to Deadhorse, AK.  I got a flat tire about 50 miles north of Coldfoot which was no fun.  I had the stuff to patch it, though, and was back on the road in about 20 minutes or so.  Got up here around 4ish and took a tour of the oil fields which ended up at the northern coast, where I took a <strong>quick</strong> swim.  Air temp was 31 with windchill and the water was about 34.  Refreshing.  Anyways, I have so many pictures and photos to share from the last two days but sadly, it must wait.  Today was a good one and it represents the the culmination of  many months of planning and thinking.  I&#8217;m glad you all could share it with me.  I&#8217;ll post more on it later, but for now you can check out some pictures that I put on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/">Flickr</a>.  More later.</p>
