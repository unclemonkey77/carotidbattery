The ride up was good and motocompy performed rather swimmingly. The temperature between San Diego and San Bernardino was probably low to mid nineties and the system didn&#8217;t die, so it&#8217;s passed its first test. I suppose I passed my first test as well. Two and a half hours on the bike and my system didn&#8217;t die either. Today was good, too. We rented a pontoon boat and spent about four sunburnt hours out on Big Bear Lake&#8230;swimming, talking, enjoying family. Ok, so <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/17jun06.htm">here&#8217;s</a> part of my trip up the mountain&#8230;some good twisting roads. Here till Thursday and then off to northern lands.
