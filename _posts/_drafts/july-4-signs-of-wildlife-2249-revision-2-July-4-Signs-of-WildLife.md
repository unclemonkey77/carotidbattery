 <p>It&#8217;s after midnight and the last two days have been longs ones.  859 miles long, to be exact.  Anyways, I rolled in to Smithers, BC today after riding for over 12 hours and almost 500 miles and after a short look for campsites I gave in and got a room.  The one campsite I found was actually pretty nice, but as soon as I found out that it didn&#8217;t have a shower, I nixed it and moved on.  Anyways, I really need sleep so I&#8217;ll slap a few pict ures on here and then I&#8217;ll write more later on.  So here they are: an action shot, bugs, and some fun signs.  </p> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/182253141/"><img alt="View from the road" src="http://static.flickr.com/59/182253141\_cd65267104\_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/182253139/"><img alt="Bugs" src="http://static.flickr.com/54/182253139\_2ab65e2ced\_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/182253135/"><img alt="Eh!" src="http://static.flickr.com/57/182253135\_c3092d8dbe\_t.jpg" height="82" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/182253138/"><img alt="Meece!" src="http://static.flickr.com/57/182253138\_795255e0e4\_t.jpg" height="86" width="100" /></a> <p>I saw signs warning me of deer, elk, moose, and longhorn sheep&#8230;I saw none of them. I <em>did</em> see a little black bear running through a field and a momma duck with her three ducklings waiting patiently at the side of the road for it to be clear so she could cross.  The bear didn&#8217;t eat me, nor did it make an attempt at eating me&#8230;so my first bear encounter of the trip went well.  The duck was a bit more aggressive.  I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.  Oh, and that Microsoft interview thing was cool.  It will be online in about two weeks and I&#8217;ll make sure you all get the word.  More on that later on.  Must&#8230;.sleep&#8230;</p>
