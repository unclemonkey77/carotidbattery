Another incredible day.&#160; Incredible, and long, and tiring.&#160; I&#8217;m going to keep this short&#160; because there aren&#8217;t any electrical hookups at the campsite I&#8217;m at, but I wanted to post something small because it was such an amazing day.&#160; I started off in Crescent City and made my way up the 199 through the Jedediah Smith National Redwood Park.&#160; That took me to the Oregon border where I stayed on the 199 until I got to the I-5.&#160; Took that south and then a few smaller roads brought me to the 62 which goes all the way to the lake.&#160; Riding next to the Rogue River in this section was truly an experience.&#160; There&#8217;s one portion where the river travels underground making a natural bridge out of the lava rock.&#160; Crater Lake was spectacular.&#160; I won&#8217;t be able to put it into words so I&#8217;m not going to try.&#160; The roads were clear but there was a ton of snow everywhere else.&#160; I saw a few dear&#8230;came within feet of hitting one&#8230;dodged some thunderstorms and made it down the mountain on the 138.&#160; After a little bit of searching I found a nice camping spot right on the Umpqua River and here I sit on my motorcycle, typing away on this post before heading to bed.&#160; The other campers must think I&#8217;m a weirdo&#8230;that&#8217;s ok, I kindof think the same thing.&#160; The phone connection isn&#8217;t too strong out here so I&#8217;m going to keep it to one picture, but when I get somewhere with a decent wifi signal I&#8217;ll have an uploading bonanza.&#160; Oh, and for everyone that&#8217;s left comments&#8230;thank you.&#160; I haven&#8217;t had a chance to respond just because I&#8217;m riding and posting all day long, but know that it&#8217;s appreciated and that I enjoy your comments.&#160; Thanks.&#160; Ok, and for the picture&#8230;this is me and Crater Lake, standing in a place I shouldn&#8217;t have been.&#160; Good night.
