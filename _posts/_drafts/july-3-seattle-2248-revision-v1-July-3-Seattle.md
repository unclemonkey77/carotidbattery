I&#8217;m writing this from a parking lot&#8230;exciting, I know.  Anyways, I&#8217;m doing a quick interview deal with some folks at [www.on10.net](http://www.on10.net) and they asked if I would do some realtime blogging.  It&#8217;s pretty cool to think that other folks are interested in this and it&#8217;s fun (strange) to be on camera.  So, I&#8217;ll write some more later on today, but here&#8217;s a quick one to let you all know where I am at and what I&#8217;m doing.  After I&#8217;m done here it&#8217;s off to Canada and places north.  More later on&#8230;
