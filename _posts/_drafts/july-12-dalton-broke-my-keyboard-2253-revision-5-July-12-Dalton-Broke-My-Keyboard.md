"Aieeeeeee!&#160; Motocompy es muerto!"&#160; That was my thought as I pushed the power button and received a SYSTEM DISK ERROR.&#160; I&#8217;ve had problems with  
the computer before, but system disk stuff usually means death.&#160; The story ends up well, but let me first tell you how I came to this point.&#160; Two words: Dalton Highway.&#160; The Dalton Highway, also known as Alaska State Route 11, is a road that leads from just north of Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay, takes you through some of the most beautiful terrain you&#8217;ll ever see, and will never feel the soft touch of my motorcycle&#8217;s tires again.&#160; I can&#8217;t remember three more challenging and rewarding days than the three that took me up and back on the Dalton Highway.&#160; I&#8217;ll shall now try to summarize those days and the events that transpired therein.

I left Eielson AFB on the morning of the 9th and drove northwest up AK-2 to the point where it meets up with the Dalton Highway, some 80 miles north of Fairbanks.&#160; The whole time I was wondering what I was going to be met with.&#160; I had heard and read so much about this road that it had almost reach mythical proportions for me.&#160; I finally got there and the gravel greeted me cheerily as if to say, "Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ve ridden on gravel before, this won&#8217;t be a problem for you&#8230;(sinister laugh under breath)".&#160; Indeed, I had ridden on gravel before and I felt fairly confident in my abilities to navigate said road surface.&#160; The Dalton Highway broke me, and my bike, and my computer, and nearly my spirit.&#160; I can&#8217;t count how many times I was certain I was going to crash/drop the bike/get a flat, etc.&#160; I pulled into Coldfoot, AK, that afternoon desiring only two things: time away from my bike and a beer.&#160; I found both.&#160;&#160;&#160; The next day was even more difficult and beautiful.&#160; I already told you all about the flat tire, but I didn&#8217;t tell you about the rain or the mud, or the crazy potholes, or the dramatic temperature drop to below freezing as I road across the barren tundra leading up to the coast.&#160;&#160; The ride was certainly difficult but was also beautiful and even fun, at times.&#160; I would be frustrated and tired, concentrating on the road and nothing else, when suddenly I was met with something that didn&#8217;t seem to fit in with my exasperation: a rainbow, fireweed (which is a purple flower that comes up in areas where there&#8217;s been a fire), a powerful river like the Yukon, or an amazing mountain in the distance.&#160;&#160; It was as though God was giving me signs to help me break through my current frustration and appreciate everything around me. I crossed the Arctic Circle on the 9th and pass through the Brooks Range on the 10th.&#160; Atigun Pass divides the vast coastal tundra plains and the inland boreal forest, and is both beautiful and eerie in its color and shape.

Hmmm&#8230;Ok, I&#8217;m starting to get long winded with this.&#160; Let me try to speed things up a bit.&#160; Sooooo, I road to Coldfoot on the first day.&#160; Highlites from this ride: Yukon River, Arctic Circle (there was a sign posted here about a wolf nearby that had attacked a woman&#8230;I found out later that the same wolf had tried to run down a guy on a motorcycle), and fireweed.&#160; The next day I woke up early, after trying to sleep through the lack of darkness, the presence of rain, and the intermittent yelping from the Mush Team Huskies in the woods nearby.&#160; Fifty miles north of Coldfoot is where I got my flat, but just after that is when I got to Atigun Pass and then started descending towards the coast.&#160; The crazy thing about this road is that there will be brief spots of decent asphalt or hard packed/sealed gravel&#8230;just enough to lull you into thinking that the worst is behind you and then, wham! potholes a&#8217;plenty.&#160; On more than one occasion I would hit potholes large enough to nearly shake the handlebars out of my hands.&#160; Highlites of the second day: Atigun Pass, beautiful blue skies with lush green tundra beneath (it reminded me of the Windows XP default desktop picture with the clouds and rolling hills&#8230;just way cooler and not so digital).&#160; I stayed at the Prudhoe Bay Hotel there in Deadhorse&#8230;a first rate establishment, sortof.&#160; Deadhorse exists only to support the oilfields up there and there are no actual residents, just temporary workers.&#160; I stayed where they stay.&#160; The Arctic Ocean was cold, (imagine that?) but it was fun to get in and join the Arctic Polar Bear club.

I met another couple of bikers that day, Andy and Scott, from Ontario, Canada.&#160; They were on sport bikes, also not very suited for the dirt/gravel/mud road, and we decided to all ride back together the next day and to ride all the way back to Fairbanks, skipping the overnight in Coldfoot.&#160; We were all ready to be done with the Dalton.&#160; Scott and Andy were great guys and were just starting an [Iron Butt](http://www.ironbutt.com/about/default.cfm) challenge to drive from Deadhorse, AK, to Key West, FL.&#160; We began our ride the next day at about 10:45 and quickly put a good amount of miles behind us.&#160; Then the rain set in.&#160; A few equations here: If "Rain + dirt and gravel = mud" and "mud + motorcycle without dirt bike tires = instability" then "brian + mud = unhappily unstable".&#160; Check me on that&#8230;my algebraic rules might be a bit off, but you get the point.&#160; Scott and I nearly went down on a number of occasions.&#160; I was right behind him and every time I saw his back tire fishtail I would brace myself because I knew I was next.&#160; Apart from the mud, the roads were in much better condition than they were the day before.&#160; The road crews are constantly wetting and grading the roads (fun if you get behind the wetting truck&#8230;see above equations) and things were much smoother for our trip back.&#160; We pulled back into Fairbanks at about 4am and promptly went to sleep.&#160; The 24-hour sunlight helps for making long rides like that but it seemed to hit us all at once.&#160; The day wasn&#8217;t all easy, though.&#160; Scott&#8217;s bike kept overheating because his radiator was packed with mud.&#160; Andy got a flat.&#160; Motocompy got beaten to a pulp and stopped working.&#160; I had to take him completely apart at Coldfoot and when I did I found numerous loose or missing screws, and a disconnected hard drive.&#160; I pulled out the keyboard later on and found two of the keys had been shaken off.&#160; All in all, the damage done by Dalton to myself or the other folks on bikes that I came into contact with on my trip up amounted to: 2 flat tires, a cracked crank case, and some cracked handle bars (from when one guy went down.&#160; He was OK, just got caught in some mud).&#160;&#160; That&#8217;s all in a three day period&#8230; We woke up after our long ride, ate breakfast and took our bikes to a car wash to pressure wash all the mud off of the radiators, exhaust systems, lights&#8230;everything.&#160; That took a fair amount of time but when we were done we said our goodbyes and parted ways, Andy and Scott were heading for Whitehorse in Canada and I pointed my newly cleaned bike towards Denali.&#160; It was a good ride down there (I mean, heck, the entire road was paved) and the park was beautiful,&#160; I couldn&#8217;t actually see Mt. McKinley from the 75 mile viewpoint because of the weather, but I did see some beautiful landscape and a moose.&#160; I spent the night in Cantwell Junction and am heading out onto the Denali highway shortly&#8230;yet another gravel road, but this one should be a bit shorter and better maintained.

Ok, so I could write or talk about this experience for much longer, but my guess is that it&#8217;s much more interesting to me since it&#8217;s so fresh and vivid in my mind&#8217;s eye and that my lame description isn&#8217;t going to quite do it justice.&#160; Anyways, here&#8217;s some pictures from those few days (more on my Flickr page) as well as a video from our passage of Atigun.&#160; Most of my other videos would make you sick from all the shaking and bouncing around.&#160; Plus, there was usually mud, dust or rain stuck to my windshield&#8230;or the camera was shaken off of its mount.&#160; Not the best conditions for movie production.&#160; One more video from the Arctic coast.&#160; Notice the weird layer of clouds that comes down to just above the horizon.
