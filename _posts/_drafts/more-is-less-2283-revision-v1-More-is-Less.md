As I’ve alluded to in the past, I am of the opinion that Microsoft uses the shotgun approach with their products a little too much and the result is too often confusion.&nbsp; In one of my <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/archive/2009/03/02/part-2-more-confusion.aspx" target="_blank">previous posts</a> about MS’s confusing offerings I described a few of these “similar product shotgunnings”, and mentioned Live Mesh and Skydrive as specific examples.&nbsp; I should have included a few more into that mix…

&#8211; Windows Live Sync is not new to the party and should have received a mention in my previous post.&nbsp; It used to be Folder Share (a useful utility that I would use to sync audio recording files between computers) but was recently changed to Live Sync to better fit in with the rest of the Live family of products.

&#8211; SyncToy is also not a new product, nor has it changed names recently, but it too is another file syncing/backup offering from MS.

&#8211; Microsoft MyPhone…very much a niche product, but still has file sync/backup capabilities.

So, here we are…Microsoft has given me not one, not two…not three…not four…but five file syncing utilities.&nbsp; Each one is unique, each one has overlap.&nbsp; Each one is maddeningly insufficient on its own.&nbsp; I am forced to use at least two of these, probably three, to take care of the different file syncing needs I have.&nbsp; Here’s what each one does:

1. **<a href="http://www.mesh.com" target="_blank">Live Mesh</a>** – In my opinion, Live Mesh is the most capable and promising of the products.&nbsp; Remote Desktop is great.&nbsp; Mobile integration is very promising&nbsp;

3. **<a href="http://sync.live.com/" target="_blank">Live Sync</a>**– Great for syncing files across multiple computers within or outside of your home network.

5. <a href="http://sn1-p1.myphone.microsoft.com/mkweb/Start.po?mkt=en-US" target="_blank">MyPhone</a> – Mobile-centric.&nbsp; Awesome for backing up text messages.

Each one of these products leaves me needing one of the other products to pick up the slack…or makes me look elsewhere for a better product.&nbsp; Case in point, I use Google Sync to sync my Calendar and Contacts with Gmail and Google Calendar.&nbsp; The only thing missing there is Tasks, but it beats anything MS is offering for my Windows Mobile device.

So, let me just say what I would like to see from MS in the area of file syncing, sharing and backup.&nbsp; Who knows…maybe this is all in the works already.&nbsp; I just think the confusion tactics in the meantime aren’t helping.&nbsp; So, here it is, MS…my wish list:

> -At least 25GB of online storage.  
> -No less than 4GB/file limit  
> -Web client with a built-in file viewer, ala Live Mesh but better…with Office Live Workspace integration that allows me to actually view Office files online.&nbsp; (Think Google Docs, but better)  
> -Mobile client that allows two-way sync of all photos, video and text messages and syncs my calendar, contacts and tasks with Outlook on my home computer and Office Live.  
> -Internal, and external syncing and sharing across computers and drives without limitation.&nbsp; Built-in scheduling.  
> -Oh, and keep all of the “Pros” from above.

Is that too much to ask?&nbsp; I’m open to hearing that I’m expecting too much here but I honestly don’t think I am.&nbsp; Could we even just try to trim this list down to two, more capable products?&nbsp; Maybe one geared towards the mobile users and one that’s more desktop-centric?&nbsp; Ok, my monthly MS rant is now done.&nbsp; I’ll wait expectantly for them to jump all over this…yeah…
