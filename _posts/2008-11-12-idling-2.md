Do you ever stop and listen to your mind when you're not engaged in active thought? Try it sometime...when you're in the car, sitting at your desk, etc. I'll catch my mind wandering in strange worlds, thinking inconsequential things, rambling to itself...really weird stuff. Try it sometime and let me know if I'm alone in this. The mind is such a powerful thing...where could it go and what could it do if it were being actively guided in these periodic "downtimes"? I don't want my brain to be on idle...I want a disciplined mind that takes thoughts captive...making them submit! Where does your mind wander?
