<img height="59" alt="11.gif" hspace="20" width="59" align="left" vspace="20" border="0" src="/images/carotidbattery_com/11.gif" />I was on the phone with my girlfriend the other night, talking about rain, among other things.  She lives just north of San Francisco which recently set a personal best in the &#8220;Most Days of Rain in one Month&#8221; category, scoring an impressive 25 out of 31.  Over the last few weeks we&#8217;ve talked a number of times about the joys of near continuous rainfall, and she&#8217;s pretty well convinced that moving from the Bay Area is a must.  On the night in question, however, we somehow started talking about the children we sponsor and I started reading a letter to her from Elijah who lives in Isiolo, Kenya.  The letter stated, in a 13-year old&#8217;s broken English (which is much better than my Swahili will ever be) that &#8220;the rain has taken about one year without raining.  So the drought is very bad this time, but we pray to God because He is giving us our daily bread.&#8221;  A mazing.  One year without rain, and for us a few days in a row seems unbearable.  I&#8217;m not giving my girlfriend a hard time, by the way&#8230;she was much quicker than I to point out the amazing disparity between how we view rain here and how they view it 9500 miles away in Kenya.  The great thing is that the very next morning I was reading the news and an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4885344.stm">article</a> entitled &#8220;Heavy rain in drought-hit Kenya&#8221; lept off the screen.  Incredible.<br />
