<img height="64" alt="operalogo.gif" hspace="20" width="70" align="right" border="1" src="/images/carotidbattery\_com/operalogo.gif" />I recently got this new Pocket PC <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/i\_mate_pda2k-962.php">phone</a>, (actually, I picked it up off of ebay, which is a much longer story than I wish to address here; a story that involves fraud, theft, Paypal claims, etc.) and have really been digging it.  Problem is, the Windows Mobile 2003 Internet Explorer doesn&#8217;t really cut it.  It&#8217;s cumbersome and many websites recognize it as an old version of regular Windows IE and won&#8217;t load up.  So, I went in search of a better browser.  My search first lead me to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minimo/">Minimo</a>, which is a mobile version of Firefox.  I&#8217;m pretty well sold on the non-mobile version of Firefox so I figured that would solve my problems.  In some ways it&#8217;s better than IE but it has some stability issues and doesn&#8217;t quite run as smoothly as I&#8217;d like it to (although there&#8217;s a new version that I&#8217;d like to check out a bit more).  So, today I continued my search and the first Google result, <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/products/winmobileppc/">Opera</a> for Windows Mobile, seems to address my desires for a great Pocket PC browser.  I just installed it and am already very impressed.  Tabbed browsing, ala Firefox.  Easy secured website viewing&#8230;good for viewing my bank account info.  Works with sites that IE wouldn&#8217;t, i.e. Southwest.com, and generally loads pages much more quickly.  Very nice product, and it&#8217;s still only a Beta release, so I&#8217;m looking forward to the final version.  Pretty cool.  I think the Minimo deal will be something to follow as well, but so far Opera looks to be the best browser for me&#8230;or at least as long as it&#8217;s a free beta download.<br />
