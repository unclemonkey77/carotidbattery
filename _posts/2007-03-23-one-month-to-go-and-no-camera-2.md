 <p>So I asked her to marry me on November 30th&#8230;it&#8217;s now 12:22am on March 23rd and I&#8217;m finally getting around to writing something new.  My friend, JP, gave me some <strike>scathing criticism</strike> encouragement when he saw the lull in my interweb presence and that was just what I needed for inspiration.  I&#8217;m falling asleep as I begin this post so I know full well it won&#8217;t be a long one.  Just wanted to write a quick update on the life of Brian.</p> <p>I remember hearing other guys talk about how busy their lives were in the time leading up to their wedding and thinking, &#8220;Come on&#8230;it can&#8217;t be that bad.  Seriously, you&#8217;re a guy&#8230;it&#8217;s not like you have to pick out the sheets and towels, right?&#8221;  Now four months into engaged life, I realize how right and wrong I was.  No, I&#8217;m not picking out sheets and towels&#8230;but I&#8217;m present when all of those decisions are made.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I give my input when it&#8217;s requested/needed, and I&#8217;m not complaining about the process, I&#8217;m mostly just poking fun at myself for my past miscalculations.</p> <p>Actually, I think things have gone pretty well for trying to squeeze what I&#8217;m convinced should be three and a half years of wedding planning into the last four months.  On a scale of 1 to &#8220;Splendid&#8221;, my fiancee comes in at a cool &#8220;Ridiculously Incredible&#8221;&#8230;I&#8217;d say she&#8217;s a keeper.  (Now let&#8217;s just hope she&#8217;s saying the same thing about me&#8230;)  We&#8217;ve taken care of most of the major stuff and are now finalizing, ordering, planning, paying and calling the final touches of this wedding into existence.  Should be a lot of fun&#8230;</p> <p>Ok, I&#8217;m going to go to bed.  Oh, quickly, the reason for the post&#8217;s title&#8230; I went up to Julian, CA, this last weekend and left my camera up there.  That&#8217;s what I think , anyways, since it wasn&#8217;t with me when I got back.  That <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2003_reviews/optios4.html">camera</a> had been all around the world with me&#8230;I&#8217;m sad to see it go.  I went ahead and ordered its updated <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0607/06072401pentaxoptios7.asp">descendant</a> earlier tonight, but in deference to my misplaced photographic companion I shall leave this post photoless.  Goodnight.</p>
