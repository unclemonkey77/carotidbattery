 <p><img height="135" alt="carotidartery.jpg" hspace="20" width="125" align="left" border="1" src="/images/carotidbattery\_com/carotidartery.jpg" />ok, so i figured i&#8217;d try to explain the name of the site, &#8220;carotidbattery.&#8221;  honestly, i mostly just like the sound of it.  it rolls off of your tongue rather nicely, don&#8217;t you think?  it&#8217;s a play on words, as i&#8217;m sure you all picked up on; a combination of &#8220;corroded battery&#8221; and &#8220;carotid artery&#8221;.  ok, so, what does that have to do with a person&#8217;s website?  well, i like the symbolism of the heart as the body&#8217;s battery, our power source, both physically and emotionally/spiritually.  well, if that&#8217;s the case, then mine&#8217;s corroded.  it&#8217;s imperfect.  it needs work.  the corrosion needs to be removed, constantly, and it returns if the battery is left unattended for a long enough period of time.  but it is still my power source, for good or for bad.  simply put, it needs constant attention.  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid\_artery">carotid arteries</a>, on the other hand, are the most important arteries in the body and, while your heart may be in perfect condition, it does no good if the link to the rest of the body (namely, your head) is in disrepair.  i have become increasingly aware of the importance of the link between my mind and my heart.  i can know something thoroughly and believe it completely, but if that doesn&#8217;t seep into my heart, into my power source, that which makes me actually get up and move, then that knowledge is next to useless.</p> <p>ok, so to be completely honest with you, i came up with most of that after i had chosen the name for its sound, but the more i think of it the more i like it and the more i can see how appropriate it is for me, today.</p>
