I leave on my trip in nine days and there is much to complete on my motorcycle computer, which, from here on out, shall be called the "motocompy".  I've done quite a bit of work on it in the last few days and just put the thing back into my car today to try something new out...and here's the something new.  I recorded my gps track which you can find <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/8June06.htm">here</a>, and at the same time I recorded the video below.  Simultaneous GPS and video, which is so uber-nerd that it should make you all wonder how I have a girlfriend (unless you are my girlfriend, in which case you should realize how awesomely industrious I am and how alluring all of this technical mumbo-jumbo makes me.) In either case, enjoy your venture into my nerddom. <br />
