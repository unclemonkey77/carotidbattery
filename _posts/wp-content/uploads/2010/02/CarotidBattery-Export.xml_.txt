				<![CDATA[<p><img height="135" alt="carotidartery.jpg" hspace="20" width="125" align="left" border="1" src="/images/carotidbattery_com/carotidartery.jpg" />ok, so i figured i'd try to explain the name of the
 site, "carotidbattery."  honestly, i mostly just like the sound of it.  it rolls off of your tongue rather nicely, don't you think?  it's a play on words, as i'm sure you all picked up on; a combination of "corroded battery" and "carotid artery".  ok, so, what does that have to do with a person's website?  well, i like the symbolism of the heart as the body's battery, our power source, both physically and emotionally/spiritually.  well, if that's the case, then mine's corroded.  it's imperfect.  it needs work.  the corrosion needs to be removed, constantly, and it returns if the battery is left unattended for a long enough period of time.  but it is still my power source, for good or for bad.  simply put, it needs constant attention.  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_artery">carotid arteries</a>, on the other hand, are the most important arteries in the body and, while your heart may be in perfect condition, it does no good if the link to the rest of the body (namely, your head) is in disrepair.  i have become increasingly aware of the importance of the link between my mind and my heart.  i can know something thoroughly and believe it completely, but if that doesn't seep into my heart, into my power source, that which makes me actually get up and move, then that knowledge is next to useless.</p>
<p>ok, so to be completely honest with you, i came up with most of that after i had chosen the name for its sound, but the more i think of it the more i like it and the more i can see how appropriate it is for me, today.</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<img height="64" alt="operalogo.gif" hspace="20" width="70" align="right" border="1" src="/images/carotidbattery_com/operalogo.gif" />I recently got this new Pocket PC <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/i_mate_pda2k-962.php">phone</a>, (actually, I picked it up off of ebay, which is a much longer story than I wish to address here; a story that involves fraud, theft, Paypal claims, etc.) and have really been digging it.  Problem is, the Windows Mobile 2003 Internet Explorer doesn't really cut it.  It's cumbersome and many websites recognize it as an old version of regular Windows IE and won't load up.  So, I went in search of a better browser.  My search first lead me to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minimo/">Minimo</a>, which is a mobile version of Firefox.  I'm pretty well sold on the non-mobile version of Firefox so I figured that would solve my problems.  In some ways it's better than IE but it has some stability issues and doesn't quite run as smoothly as I'd like it to (although there's a new version that I'd like to check out a bit more).  So, today I continued my search and
 the first Google result, <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/products/winmobileppc/">Opera</a> for Windows Mobile, seems to address my desires for a great Pocket PC browser.  I just installed it and am already very impressed.  Tabbed browsing, ala Firefox.  Easy secured website viewing...good for viewing my bank account info.  Works with sites that IE wouldn't, i.e. Southwest.com, and generally loads pages much more quickly.  Very nice product, and it's still only a Beta release, so I'm looking forward to the final version.  Pretty cool.  I think the Minimo deal will be something to follow as well, but so far Opera looks to be the best browser for me...or at least as long as it's a free beta download.<br />]]>

				<![CDATA[<img height="59" alt="11.gif" hspace="20" width="59" ali
gn="left" vspace="20" border="0" src="/images/carotidbattery_com/11.gif" />I was on the phone with my girlfriend the other night, talking about rain, among other things.  She lives just north of San Francisco which recently set a personal best in the "Most Days of Rain in one Month" category, scoring an impressive 25 out of 31.  Over the last few weeks we've talked a number of times about the joys of near continuous rainfall, and she's pretty well convinced that moving from the Bay Area is a must.  On the night in question, however, we somehow started talking about the children we sponsor and I started reading a letter to her from Elijah who lives in Isiolo, Kenya.  The letter stated, in a 13-year old's broken English (which is much better than my Swahili will ever be) that "the rain has taken about one year without raining.  So the drought is very bad this time, but we pray to God because He is giving us our daily bread."  Amazing.  One year without rain, and for us a few days in a row seems unbearable.  I'm not giving my girlfriend a hard time, by the way...she was much quicker than I to point out the amazing disparity between how we view rain here and how they view it 9500 miles away in Kenya.  The great thing is that the very next morning I was reading the news and an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4885344.stm">article</a> entitled "Heavy rain in drought-hit Kenya" lept off the screen.  Incredible.<br />]]>

				<![CDATA[<p><img height="73" alt="old ship.jpg" hspace="10" width="100" align="right" border="1" src="/images/carotidbattery_com/old ship.jpg" />When I was seventeen I made a rather large decision...a commitment...a commitment that I am just now seeing the end of.  I had no money for college but got decent grades in high school and somehow found myself at the Naval Academy in the Summer of 1996.  The next four years of my life were consumed by a rather non-standard college experience.  I finished up there and spent a few months attending random training schools before stepping onboard <a href="http://www.john-paul-jones.navy.mil/">USS JOHN PAUL JONES</a> in April of 2001.  Two and a half years later the entire crew shifted over to <a href="http://www.higgins.navy.mil/">USS HIGGINS</a> and I spent six more months there, completing my tour in April of 2004.  I've spent the last two years as a naval instructor at a base on top of Point Loma in San Diego, and that brings me to today.  I will be getting out of the Navy in 13 days and my future is an uncertain one, but that's a good thing, I think.  I will hopefully pass my Real Estate Broker's exam on June 14th and am planning on working part time at <a href="http://www.rockler.com">Rockler Woodworking</a> when I return from my motorcycle trip at the end of July.  My girlfriend is moving to San Diego from Santa Rosa in August, which will be great.  Long distance relationships are hard for whatever length of time.  I'm looking forward to working on my house, working on music, working on woodworking....that seems like a lot of working, but that's what I enjoy.  A new life is ahead of me and I'm ready for the change.  My last 10 years in the Navy and at the Academy have been good ones.  I've learned an amazing amount.  I've been able to do and see much more than most of my peers.  I've flown helicopters 
and turbo props, performed a <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/images/emerblow.avi">simulated-emergency surfacing</a> from 600 feet underwater to the ocean's surface in a Ballistic Missile Submarine, jumped off the sail planes of that same submarine and gone swimming somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean,  dived off the back of JOHN PAUL JONES into the Pacific, fired all sorts of cool guns for training, ridden scooters at 25mph on the highway in Hawaii (one of my smarter moments), worn a shower cap out in public in Singapore with my friend Andy (they didn't quite know what to do with us there), jumped off <a href="http://www.ozoutback.com.au/postcards/postcards_forms/litchfield/Source/7.htm">waterfalls</a> in Australia, scuba dived in Guam and on the Great Barrier Reef, navigated HIGGINS back through the Great Barrier Reef on our way home from deployment, enjoyed 160<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol">°<font face="Times New Roman">F</font> </span></span>heat index temperatures in the Gulf, visited all sorts of foreign ports and worked with some amazing people...and now it's time to say move on.  Good memories and great opportunities.  I hope the next ten years of my life are just as eventful...just with less nights spent on watch.</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<img src="http://carotidbattery.com/images/carotidbattery_com/ship.jpg" alt="ship.jpg" align="left" border="1" height="76" hspace="10" width="102" />That's the amount of time I have left as a member of o
ur Active Duty Military.  Today was my last day at work, but the Navy owns you 24-7, for good and for bad, so I'm not out until it's no longer today.  A lot of people asked me if I was super happy to be done...which is an interesting question.  Yes, I'm very happy to be done.  I'm very happy to be able to pursue something new and different.  I'm happy to be able to grow out my remaining hair and measly facial growth.  (37 minutes now).  Yes, it's time to be done and I have many things I'm looking forward to.  It's strange, though, because had you asked me if I was happy to be getting out of the Navy two years ago when I was leaving the ship I would have gone into great detail in describing how ready I was to be done with the Navy and how much I couldn't wait to put that part of my life behind me.  Two years of working behind a desk and in front of a classroom have tempered my readiness and now it just feels like the completion of the inevitable rather than a much yearned after freedom.  I went to work this morning a little earlier than i have been, cleaned up my desk, filed some reports, said my goodbyes and walked out to my car.  I have to confess that i teared up a bit as I left the building, not because I was sad to go but because it represented a monumental shift in my life and I started to feel the gravity of that.  Yeah, I know, I probably should have felt that coming a little while before I was leaving the building, but there's just something about walking out a door and looking back on a place you <i>used</i> to work that makes you also start to think about where your life was, is and is going...everything that's brought you to now and made you what you are.  Those are big thoughts and they got the best of me.  Ok, well I've got 19 minutes left until I'm done so I figure I might as well stay up and bring in my own personal new year.  Here's to new beginnings.<br />]]>

I'm trying to study for my real estate exam and Jon brought up a previous conversation we had had where I informed him that he was a magma owner.  If you own land you technically own it all the way to the center of the earth.  Riveting. Ok, typing on my phone is getting old.  More later.]]></content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[I leave on my trip in nine days and there is much to complete on my motorcycle computer, which, from here on out, shall be called the "motocompy".  I've done quite a bit of work on it in the last few days and just put the thing back into my car today to try something new out...and here's the something new.  I recorded my gps track which you can find <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/8June06.htm">here</a>, and at the same time I recorded the video below.  Simultaneous GPS and video, which is so uber-nerd that it should make you all wonder how I have a girlfriend (unless you are my girlfriend, in which case you should realize how awesomely industrious I am and how alluring all of this technical mumbo-jumbo makes me.) In either case, enjoy your venture into my nerddom.<br /><br /><br /><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Mal4rStTLY0" /><embed

				<![CDATA[Part 3:<br /><br /><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/P9eO6Yx3s30" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/P9eO6Yx3s30" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="425"></embed></object><br /><br />I drove it up to my Mom and Dad's house this afternoon with the motocompy in place and I think it was a success...a learning success.  The screen was pretty wobbly because the hinge had too much play in the joint, if that makes any sense.  I think I need to find a slightly larger post for the hinge so that it doesn't bounce around quite as much.  Not that it really mattered today...the glare made the screen fairly unusable.  Also, the power inverter was giving me some problems.  I have two power inverters and the one that I'm using right now is a higher wattage rating and it has a fan in it but it also likes to cut out at odd times...so, I think I'm going to ta
ke it out for a spin with the other inverter and see how that works.  Overall, I was pretty pleased with how everything worked.  The computer stayed in place, nothing caught on fire, and I didn't crash.  I'd call it a success.]]>

The ride up was good and motocompy performed rather swimmingly.  The temperature between San Diego and San Bernardino was probably low to mid nineties and the system didn't die, so it's passed its first test.  I suppose I passed my first test as well.  Two and a half hours on the bi
ke and my system didn't die either.  Today was good, too.  We rented a pontoon boat and spent about four sunburnt hours out on Big Bear Lake...swimming, talking, enjoying family.  Ok, so <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/17jun06.htm">here's</a> part of my trip up the mountain...some good twisting roads.  Here till Thursday and then off to northern lands.]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Today proved challenging for me.  I decided to take motocompy out for a spin to make sure everything was working well before the long trip tomorrow.  I've done a lot of work on the system in the last few days, with the help of my brother, Jon, and I wanted to make sure it was ready to go and there were no nasty surprises as I was leaving.  I took motocompy ou
t to the bike, set him down, turned him on, started using things...started <em>trying</em> to use things...and found that things weren't usable.  My touchscreen, which had worked so well since I had purchased it in November, had chosen the afternoon before my departure to go cold to my touch.  Long story and I'm not really even sure what all happened...it was a flurry of driver installs, driver uninstalls, driver reinstalls, system reboots, etc.  Somewhere along the line it decided to work again and as of now I have a working computer with a working touchscreen.  We'll see how long that lasts.  So, while on the subject of system components (both working and non-working), I might as well list out some info about the bike, the computer, and what kind of programs I'm running.  If you're not into the technical stuff then you can just skip to the video at the bottom.  I filmed it tonight on a quick trip to ensure the computer was working properly.  Here goes...</p>

<p>I think I overdid it.  My first full day on the bike ended up being a <em>full</em> day on the bike.  I left Big Bear, CA at about 9:15 in the morning and pulled into Santa Rosa, CA 14 and a half hours and 649 miles later at 11:45.  It was a great day overall but my body paid for it.  I'll upload some stories/pictures/video/gps in a little while, but just wanted to let everyone know that the journey had begun and I and the bike are doing well.</p>
<p>Oh, and two other things.  One, I figured out why the feedback link on my last post was busted...that should be fixed.  And Two, I keep meaning to tell you all that I found out that I passed my Real Estate Broker's exam on Saturday.  It's great to have that done and out of the way.  Ok, more later.   </p>]]>

<div style="MARGIN: 1ex">
<div>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Yesterday was incredible.  Plain and 
simple, incredible.  I saw more of California in one day than I have in 
years.  I started the day in Big Bear Lake which is in the San Bernardino 
Mountains, just west of Los Angeles.  It was warm, but not bad for riding 
and it's always fun to ride in the mountains.  I came down into San 
Bernardino and rode just north of L.A. and over to the 101, north of Malibu, 
before turning south in Agoura Hills.  This was one of the highlights of 
the day as I was able to drive to the coast on Latigo Canyon Road which is 
something of a motorcycle rider's Mecca.  Dropping out of the hills onto 
Highway 1 was amazing.  The video's below and I sped it up to double speed 
to make it a little more watchable.</font></p>
<object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/T3rpfWTFkD0" />
<embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/T3rpfWTFkD0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I turned north and drove up the coast 
using a mix of Highway 1 and 101.  I went through farmland, pastures, 
coastal towns, forests, rolling hills and enjoyed the sights, sounds and 
smells.  I was talking earlier today to my friend Josh, a fellow motorcycle 
rider, and he was mentioning how great it is to have each one of your five 
senses stimulated while riding a bike.  The strawberry fields were 
great.  The pastures...not so much.  My favorite little town was 
</font><a href="http://www.ci.guadalupe.ca.us/visitor.html" target="_blank"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#0000ff" size="3"><u>Guadalupe</u></font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">.  I didn't get a chance to stop there, but 
it seemed like something from a different time and place.  Old buildings, 
wide streets with people walking down the sidewalks, cemeterie
s out in the open 
(which you don't see much of in Southern California...we hide our cemeteries in 
the hills and make them look like golf courses.  Weird.)  Just a neat 
place with a cool vibe.  I drove up Highway 1 from San Simeon to Monterey 
next and got a great view of...fog.  I did get to see some of the coast in 
certain areas, and Big Sur was beautiful.  In some ways the fog made the 
drive that much more interesting.  Scariest parts of the day came from this 
part of the journey.  First, I almost took a bird to the face.  (I had 
an impressive bug collection on the visor at the end of the day, but a bird 
probably could have claimed me for its own collection.)  Second, while 
nearing a corner in the fog I saw a few signs that no one on a bike wants to 
see, "Pavement Ends", and then "Loose Gravel".  Sure enough, the pavement 
did end and the gravel was loose.  I held on tight and drove through it 
safely.  No fun.  Here are a few pictures and a video from that part 
of the trip.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By the time I got to Monterey I just 
wanted to be off of the bike so I headed inland and took the 101 t
he rest of the 
way to Santa Rosa.  Nothing too spectacular here but going over the Golden 
Gate Bridge as the wind was blowing the fog across the road was an 
experience.  Motorcycles aren't much fun in the wind.

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Here are a few of the GPS files from the 
day.  <a href="http://carotidbattery.com/23jun06.htm">One</a>, <a href="http://carotidbattery.com/23jun06pt2.htm">Two</a>, <a href="http://carotidbattery.com/23jun06pt3.htm">Three</a>.  I think that 
having the receiver right in front of me isn't the best because my body blocks 
its view at times.  That's why some of the maps are a little choppy in 
spots.  Oh, and one last thing...My girlfriend won a radio contest to go 
see </font><a href="http://www.matkearney.com/" target="_blank"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#0000ff" size="3"><u>Mat Kearney</u></font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> at the radio studio.  That was today, so it 
was my girlfriend, her sister and I in the studio with Mat.  He sang a 
couple of songs and then we hung out and had pizza.  Good time.  I 
have both of his CD's and they're good...you'd like him...go on, give him a 
try.  That's all for now.</font></p></div></div>]]>

				<![CDATA[<div style="margin: 1ex;">
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">More beautiful driving along California's 
coast.  I started out in Santa Rosa a little before 10 and took the 
128  west to the coast.  128 led to Mountain View Drive and both were 
great on the bike.  A few washed out roads and a few 16% grades, but 
overall a fun stretch of road.  Mountain View put me on the coast near 
Point Arena and I took Lighthouse Road out to....yep, the Lighthouse.  They 
wanted $5 to go all the way to the lighthouse so I stayed back a little ways and 
enjoyed the view from the free land.  There were a couple of guys running 
out to the lighthouse and we stopped and talked for a little while.  There 
names were Ben and Kaleo and I enjoyed the chance to hang out and take a break 
from riding.  After a few minutes there, I turned North from Point Arena to 
take the 1 and 101 all the way up the coast.  It was everything I had hoped 
it would be.  Dramatic scenes of mountains gradually giving way to the 
ocean, beautiful lagoons, redwood forests, and more.  I caught a view of 
some Elk north of Eureka and met another biker there.  His name was Adam 
and he had been on the road for over 18000 miles.  His journey had begun 
close to two months ago and had taken him 
through most of the continental U.S. 
and was leading him to Deadhorse, AK, of all places.  I'd ride up 
there with him but he's going up a little quicker than I'm planning to.  We 
road together to Crescent City where I stopped for dinner.  After dinner 
and a few phone calls I decided to look for a camp site.  It was after 10 
and as I got back on the 101 I decided that I'd save my first night of camping 
for a different night.  I had ridden almost 400 miles and didn't feel like 
fumbling with a tent in the dark at a yet to be determined camp site.  So I 
found a cheap motel, unloaded the bike and got a good night's sleep.  
Overall, it was a great day.  I felt like I became a better rider 
throughout the course of the day, and got to do it while viewing some amazing 
scenery.  One of the best parts was riding along the coast near Klamath 
while the sun was setting.  Beautiful beaches meeting dense forest...hard 
to describe.  Ok, I need to get back on the road.  Below is a video of 
some of my riding today.  In order, the four excerpts are from Mountain 
View Road, Point Arena, Somewhere north of Eureka, and Klamath at Sunset with 
Adam riding in front of me.  The first two are sped up and the last two are 
normal speed.  Some GPS files <a href="http://carotidbattery.com/27jun06pt1.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://carotidbattery.com/27jun06pt2.htm">here</a>, and a few pictures

				<![CDATA[<p>Another incredible day.  Incredible, and long, and tiring.  I'm 
going to keep this short  because there aren't any electrical hookups at 
the campsite I'm at, but I wanted 
to post something small because it was such an 
amazing day.  I started off in Crescent City and made my way up the 199 
through the Jedediah Smith National Redwood Park.  That took me to the 
Oregon border where I stayed on the 199 until I got to the I-5.  Took that 
south and then a few smaller roads brought me to the 62 which goes all the way 
to the lake.  Riding next to the Rogue River in this section was truly 
an experience.  There's one portion where the river travels underground 
making a natural bridge out of the lava rock.  Crater Lake was 
spectacular.  I won't be able to put it into words so I'm not going to 
try.  The roads were clear but there was a ton of snow everywhere 
else.  I saw a few dear...came within feet of hitting one...dodged some 
thunderstorms and made it down the mountain on the 138.  After a little bit 
of searching I found a nice camping spot right on the Umpqua River and here I 
sit on my motorcycle, typing away on this post before heading to bed.  The 
other campers must think I'm a weirdo...that's ok, I kindof think the same 
thing.  The phone connection isn't too strong out here so I'm going to keep 
it to one picture, but when I get somewhere with a decent wifi signal I'll have 
an uploading bonanza.  Oh, and for everyone that's left comments...thank 
you.  I haven't had a chance to respond just because I'm riding and posting 
all day long, but know that it's appreciated and that I enjoy your 
comments.  Thanks.  Ok, and for the picture...this is me and Crater 
Lake, standing in a place I shouldn't have been.  Good night.</p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/177494392/"><img alt="Crater Lake" src="http://static.flickr.com/48/177494392_9093540102.jpg" height="180" width="240" /></a>]]>

				<![CDATA[<a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/178195979/"><img style="FLOAT: right" alt="Rain" width="75" height="75" src="http://static.flickr.com/52/178195979_688953f139_s.jpg" /></a> ...with a subtitle of, "The Oregon Coast".  Yesterday would have been a long, painful day had it not been for my girlfriend.  She bought me a few things for my trip, things I wouldn't have thought about but thankfully she did.  One of those things happened to be a plastic poncho.  I said thank you and put everything in my bag naively hoping that I wouldn't have to use most of it (she bought me things that would keep me alive if I found myself alone in the Alaskan wild....matches, tourniquet materials, etc.  Great things to have for a trip but the kind of things you don't want to need.)  Anyways, yesterday morning I loaded up my bike and hit the road, making a quick trip to the gas station where I joked with the attendant about hoping that it did
n't rain that day.  (By the way, Oregon is Full Service only...for motorcycles it's a little strange.  They have to start the pump and hand the nozzle to you and then you do the rest.  Weird.)  Twenty minutes later I was in a Rite Aid parking lot and it was pouring.  Got my rain jacket on.  Got motocompy covered and in a dry spot.  Oh, all of the stuff loaded on the bike....hmmmm...enter girlfriend's poncho.  So, anyways, thanks goes out to her for that and for her help the rest of the day.  I don't know if you all noticed, but my post on the 28th was a little strange.  I just realized that I entitled it "July 28".  A possible reason for this is that I wasn't feeling that good when I made the post.  A probable reason for me not feeling good was that my meals for the day consisted of breakfast bar for breakfast, breakfast bar for lunch, and breakfast bar for dinner.  I was probably a little dehydrated, too.  My girlfriend explained that I should probably have at least one real meal a day.  I did that yesterday and, sure enough, it worked.  Lastly, she provided me with helpful info on camping sites which I'm very grateful for because it landed me <a href="http://www.oregonstateparks.org/park_201.php">here</a> and this is a great place.
<p>Ok, so I'll begin with some quick catch-up from the previous day.  Here's a quick video from my drive through the Redwoods and my time at Crater Lake, followed by some pictures from the day, including the lake and my first campsite.  GPS files <a href="http://carotidbattery.com/28jun06pt1.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://carotidbattery.com/28jun06pt2.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday was fun and relaxing.  I made it back to the coast at Coos Bay, OR, which seemed like a cool city.  I stayed there long enough to eat at Quiznos and buy some spandex pants (long story, but my legs were sticking to my waterproof motorcycle pants) and then turned north to head up the Oregon coast.  The coast was beautiful and the drive was easy and comfortable.  I stopped in Tillamook and ate some ice cream which my parents had told me was some of the best around...and it was.  I checked out their cheesemaking capabilities and they met with my approval.  Grade A, Tillamook.  Well done.  From Tillamook to Nehalem Bay State Park it was a quick trip and I got here just as the sun was setting.  I've been on many beaches throughout the world but this one at sunset easily ranks in the top three.  It's absolutely gigantic, and the grass comes down onto the dunes.  Alright, well I need to break camp and head north.  Apparently Astoria is where they filmed Goonies and there's some spots I need to check out.  Pictures below:  Oregon Dunes, Tillamook Cheese (with a nonstandard pose for Chad...I had noticed the eerie cardboard cutoutedness of my pictures, too), Nehalem Bay.</p>

				<![CDATA[<a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/178861888/"><img style="float: left;" alt="Nehalem in the Morning" src="http://static.flickr.com/67/178861888_6df9ee5150_s.jpg" height="75" width="75" /></a> 
<p>I'm sitting here watching Evel Knievel's story on the History Channel in my 
hotel room in Port Angeles.  Don't worry, Mom, I'm not getting any 
ideas.  Not a whole lot to write tonight because it wasn't really all that 
exciting as far as this trip as been.  I left Nehalem Bay State Park this 
morning around 10 and drove up to Astoria.  Astoria's well known for many 
things I'm sure, but for someone of my generation, the only thing that matters 
is that Astoria is where Goonies was filmed.  I have to be honest 
here...I've never seen Goonies all the way through, but what I have seen I've 
liked and I aim to watch it all later on.  Anyways, here's a picture of the 
house below with me making my best "Baby Ruth?" face.  The house is 
actually pretty nice and looks out over the Columbia River.  The Columbia 
is a very historical river as you history buffs may recall...it's where Lewis 
and Clark first invented chocolate and discovered the Rubik's Cube in 
1492.  I took the motorcycle over the Columbia and have video to prove 
it...below.  Some highlights from the rest of the day include driving by 
wood mills where they were processing cedar.  The smell made the drive much 
easier.  Also, all along the Washington coast there were these purple and 
white flowers.  I don't know what
 they're called, but they sure looked 
swell.  See for yourself...again, below.  Anyways, now I'm in Port 
Angeles, WA, where I have set up shop in a lovely (read "bargain") motel.  
I've unloaded the bike and will take it in for new tires tomorrow.  And now 
for the visceral delights.  Extra pictures are of Cannon Beach (another 
Goonies filming site) as well as one from the Washington Coast and one of the 
bike without all of my junk on it.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>I woke up today knowing that I was going to get new tires on my bike and that 
was about it.  I wasn't sure if I was going to head over to Victoria or 
down towards Seattle.  Again, the wisdom of my girlfriend prevailed and I 
made plans to enjoy the area that I was already staying in, Port Angeles.  
I picked up the bike and decided to break in my new tires on the roads of 
Olympic National Park.  I started the drive up there and that's when things 
just got strange.  I rounded one corner and saw this:</p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/179524087/"><img alt="Car, wrong side up" src="http://static.flickr.com/75/179524087_16e592cf0b_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> 
<p>An older couple from Israel had gotten distracted and simply driven off the 
side of the road.  They had both climbed out the driver's door and were 
fine.  I tried to suggest that maybe it was the dirt on the road...someone 
else commented that it wa
s a sunny day and maybe that had caused it, but the guy 
just kindof shrugged and said "Ah, it was probably just my fault" to which his 
wife rolled her eyes and pointed out that there was no dirt on the road.  I 
continued up to the top and did a bit of hiking around.  On the way up one 
of the trails I met with this fellow:</p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/179524088/"><img alt="Mountain Goat" src="http://static.flickr.com/67/179524088_5d5da5da94_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/179524089/"><img alt="Mountain Goat-2" src="http://static.flickr.com/46/179524089_4e208eb4e2_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/179524092/"><img alt="Mountain Goat-3" src="http://static.flickr.com/58/179524092_f6f2623b9f_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> 
<p>So do you think they pay the wildlife to make appearances?  I mean, I 
was taking pictures of a mountain goat...standing mere feet away from 
him/her.  My guess is that it sees people fairly frequently and that it 
couldn't care less what I was doing or how closely I was standing to it.  
My suspicions were later confirmed by this view of a dear hanging out in a 
lovely meadow with many of it's human friends, and also this neat sign of a deer 
jumping up on a person, apparently looking for food.  (By the way, I 
overheard the kid on the right ask his dad if the picture was of a 
kangaroo.  Awesome.)</p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/179526613/"><img alt="Deer" src="http://static.flickr.com/67/179526613_51d2c54c84_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/179526614/"><img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/59/179526614_dd03410ce9_t.jpg" a="" that="" is="" kangaroo="" height="75" width="100" /></a> 
<p>I later met up with a guy named Bill who told me about a cool
 dirt road 
nearby.  I headed down that way (video below) and met back up with him on 
his way back up the road.  I continued on to the bottom where I saw a sign 
that (I thought) said "PJ Lake 0.3 miles".  I headed out on my "quick" trek 
and found myself walking down steep switchbacks into a valley far below.  
Turns out that I had misread the sign and 0.3 was actually 0.9.  I'm 
convinced that most of that .9 miles both ways was spent in the vertical 
direction.  The lake was beautiful...clearest I've ever seen, and the views 
on the way to it were incredible...but the hike back up the side of that 
mountain nearly killed me.  I really need to start working out when I get 
home.  Ok, so this short post has quickly turned into a long post.  
There's the video below as well as some more pictures from the Park, the dirt 
road, and the hike (with some more pictures on Flickr).  GPS file from the 
dirt road back to Port Angeles is <a href="http://carotidbattery.com/01jul06.htm">here</a>.  I'm out of here 
tomorrow.  It's time to move on...</p>

<p><span><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none"><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal"><font size="2"><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#ffffff">Yesterday was one of the more frustrating days of the trip thus far. Frustrating, because things didn't quite go as planned. It was a good day, though, and looking back on it I fee
l silly for being frustrated...I got to see and do some amazing things today. I woke up early and drove down to the ferry landing in Port Angeles, getting there right at 7 to ensure my place on the 8:20 to Victoria. We crossed the Strait of Juan de Fuca and I was off the boat at about 10:15. I had three things planned for Victoria: see the Empress Hotel, go to Buchart Gardens and drive up the 1 to Nanaimo to catch the 3:15 ferry to Vancouver. I went one for three...I missed the 3:15 ferry. Why was I late? Because I didn't trust the GPS lady's voice, telling me to turn around and take a different route. I thought the way I was going would work just as well, but it didn't and it took me 25 miles to correct that mistake. Sadly, I didn't get to Nanaimo until 3:25. Stink. The ride up was nice, though, and it was fun to drive next to routes that I had navigated the ship through several years back. Buchart Gardens was impressive and beautiful, full of plants, trees and flowers from around the world. It used to be an old limestone quarry but was transformed by Mrs. Buchart into an colorful, peaceful (except for all of us loud tourists) landscape. Overheard quote of the day: a boy saying to his mother, "Will the garden have variety?"</font><font color="#000000">  </font></font></font></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none"><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal"><font size="2"><font face="Tahoma" color="#ffffff">Anyways, I took the ferry back to Vancouver (video below of a bunch of us exiting the ferry), dealt with city traffic, and made my way back down to Oak Harbor, WA, to stay with some friends of my brother's.  What?  Back to Washington?  Yeah, I'm meeting someone in the Seattle area today and then heading back up into Canada for the <em>long</em> part of the trip.  Which brings me to this sad truth...I probably won't be quite as regular in keeping my blog up to date as I go through Canada.  Cingular charges me big dollah to use the service of other lands and uploading pictures and video would cost me a bundle...and I'm unemployed.  So, if I can make it to some WIFI areas then you'll get some updates, otherwise you'll have to wait until I make it to Alaska.  Or maybe I can get sponsored by Yamaha and get a sweet satellite hookup.  Anyways, till next time...</font></font></span></span></span></p>

				<![CDATA[<p>I'm writing this from a parking lot...exciting, I know.  Anyways, I'm 
doing a quick interview deal with some folks at <a href="http://www.on10.net">www.on10.net</a> and they asked if I would do some 
realtime blogging.  It's pretty cool to think that other folks are 
interested in this and it's fun (strange) to be on camera.  So, I'll write 
some more later on today, but here's a quick one to let you all know where I am 
at and what I'm doing.  After I'm done here it's off to Canada and places 
north.  More later on...</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>It's after midnight and the last two days have been longs ones.  859 
miles long, to be exact.  Anyways, I rolled in to Smithers, BC today after 
riding for over 12 hours and almost 500 miles and after a short look for 
campsites I gave in and got a room.  The one campsite I found was actually 
pretty nice, but as soon as I found out that it didn't have a shower, I nixed it 
and moved on.  Anyways, I really need sleep so I'll slap a few pictures on 
here and then I'll write more later on.  So here they are: an action shot, 
bugs, and some fun signs.  </p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/182253141/"><img alt="View from the road" src="http://static.flickr.com/59/182253141_cd65267104_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/182253139/"><img alt="Bugs" src="http://static.flickr.com/54/182253139_2ab65e2ced_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/182253135/"><img alt="

<p>I saw signs warning me of deer, elk, moose, and longhorn sheep...I saw none 
of them. I <em>did</em> see a little black bear running through a field and a 
momma duck with her three ducklings waiting patiently at the side of the road 
for it to be clear so she could cross.  The bear didn't eat me, 
nor did it make an attempt at eating me...so my first bear encounter of the trip 
went well.  The duck was a bit more aggressive.  I don't want to talk 
about it.  Oh, and that Microsoft interview thing was cool.  It will 
be online in about two weeks and I'll make sure you all get the word.  More 
on that later on.  Must....sleep...</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>So much has happened since I last wrote...it's pretty difficult to know where 
to begin or what to write about without droning on and on and boring you all to 
tears.  Since the morning of the third, I've ridden about 1800 miles 
through Washington, British Columbia and now the Yukon.  I'll try to sum up 
the last three days in a not-so-painfully long synopsis.  The drive up from 
Seattle began with familiar territory.  My Mom and Dad and brother 
Kevin and I had taken a road trip a couple years back that took us through the 
southern and eastern parts of BC.  Things changed rather quickly as I made 
headway North, however, and soon I was finding myself in large canyons with 
rushing rivers and huge rock slides on either side.  It was hot, too.  
Somewhere in the mid 90's someone told me later on.  No fun.  I did 
Subway for lunch and dinner that day.  Quality.  I'm looking to take 
over for Jerrod in their new ad campaign.  I camped near Clinton, BC that 
night...nothing too spectacular, just a place to set up shop.  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/183882094/"><img style="float: right;" alt="View from the Tent" src="http://static.flickr.com/57/183882094_8bdcd30a9c_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a>I 
celebrated July 4th by waking up and driving to Smithers.  Honestly, at 
this point, I can't remember a whole lot from that drive.  I'm sure it was 
beautiful, but the days are kindof running together at this point.  The 
ones that really stand out in my mind are the 5th and 6th.  The 5th 
was a long one, almost 600 miles, and was crazy all the way 
around.  It started in Smithers where I began the day with my now 
familiar routine which tends to be a bit different depending on whether I'm 
camping or staying somewhere.  Hotel:  Try to get up by 7:30, take a
 
shower, finish whatever I'm doing with Motocompy for the trip and put away all 
the cords/wires that I don't need, pack everything else up, load up the bike, 
get all my gear on, get on the road.  Campground: Wake up whenever I wake 
up, which usually is when the sun comes up or the birds start up with their 
noise, (by the way, it was nice and bright at 5:30 this morning, but I'll 
get to that later on), skip the shower (I get that the night before to save time 
and because I really need it after riding all day), wrestle with my tent and 
sleeping bag and all of my stuff (and all the mosquitoes), somehow get 
everything to fit onto the bike and try to leave at a reasonable time.  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/183880251/"><img style="float: left;" alt="Typical Camp" src="http://static.flickr.com/69/183880251_5382448737_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a>I got 
on the road by about 9 and headed west towards the 37.  Highway 37 is a 
strange road, ranging in quality from newly paved to unpaved loose gravel, and 
everything in between.  The most abundant version was a type of pavement 
with filled potholes and no lane markers.  I spent most of the day on 
the 37 and ran the emotional gamut.  Probably the funniest part of the 
day was when another motorcycle passed me and was about 200 yards up the 
road.  A moose came up onto the road, saw him there, got scared to death 
and tried to turn around.  In the process he kindof slipped and tripped 
over his own legs and it wasn't until I got up there that he had regained his 
composure and had headed back into the trees.  I got it on video, but it's 
pretty difficult to see at such low resolution (it happens right around the 30 
second mark).  </p>

<p>I finished up the day by entering
 the Yukon (which felt like driving onto the 
moon because there had been a fire nearby and the smokey haze and crazy, rocky 
terrain made things feel, well, moonlike.)  I spent the night at a campsite 
at the junction of the 1 and the 37.  Morning came early, like I said 
before, and I had to cover my face with a t-shirt to get a couple more hours of 
sleep.  (By the way, it's 12:15am and it's still light outside as I write 
this here in Haines Junction.)  Today's roadway was much more even and 
predictable, the weather, however, was not.  Grey, dark skies, thunder, 
lightning, downpours, wind gusts....all made for some interesting riding.

road by more gigantic, beautiful lakes than I can remember.  The Yukon 
River was beautiful as were the mountains that greeted me from behind Haines 
Junction.  I head for Alaska on the 7th and will probably encounter more 
showers on the way.  By the way, Motocompy faired rather well in his rain 
clothes.  The screen isn't very usable, but it still plays music and tells 
me where to go.  Pictures below, and yes, that is a freezer bag covering up 
the touchscreen.  Classy.  Ok, my eyes are hurting so I think I'm 
going to stop typing and finish up the photos and video in the morning...er, 
later this morning.  I hope this post finds everyone well.  Thanks for 
taking this trip with me.  Your prayers, thoughts, emails, comments are 
great...keep them up.  Goodnight to you all. (Videos and pictures below as 
well as on my Flickr site which you can get to by clicking on any of these

				<![CDATA[<p>I started my ride on the 7th in Haines Junction, YT, which is about 200 miles from the US/CAN border.  After the rain the afternoon before, I was hoping the overcast skies wouldn't pummel me all day.  Although myself and the bike are dressed for the occasion, it's nice to not have to deal with it.  Only had a few sprinkles in the morning even though the skies looked ominous, and I had a nice drive through the Kluane Park and around Kluane Lake, yet another massive, beautiful body of water.  I'm sure on a sunnier day I would have been inclined to stop for longer, but I enjoyed the view from the bike, stopped for a couple pictures and moved on.  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/184572409/"><img style="FLOAT: right" height="75" alt="Kluane Lake" src="http://static.flickr.com/78/184572409_c5b1125afc_t.jpg" width="100" /></a>There was a bit of construction by the lake (the video below shows me driving by a dump truck whose tires were taller than me) but immediately following the drive around the lake is where the road got rather interesting.  The road 
was a series of potholes and dips, the kind that require you to stand up on the pegs in order to take some of the stress off of the bike's shocks, and I soon found my legs growing tired from all the standing and sitting.  Throw into that mix a fun assortment of gravel coatings, and I was very ready to get to the US border in hopes that the road would be better there (which thankfully it was).  I went through one section which was loose gravel and mud and I was fairly certain that was going to be the place where I put the bike down...somehow I made it through, though.  I ate at a little diner in Beaver Creek, enjoyed the assortment of stuffed heads and eyes looking at me, and then continued to the border.  </p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/184572558/"><img height="100" alt="Alaska Highway" src="http://static.flickr.com/70/184572558_2c75cc1b5c_t.jpg" width="75" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/184573096/"><img height="75" alt="Border" src="http://static.flickr.com/61/184573096_8f9ff8501f_t.jpg" width="100" /></a> <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/184572714/"><img height="75" alt="I Won Alaska on Ebay!" src="http://static.flickr.com/56/184572714_e0024f1b5a_t.jpg" width="100" /></a> 
<p>The scenery soon took on a much different look with wide green valleys filled with numerous small lakes and waterways.  I enjoyed this section, and enjoyed being back in the US and having phone service as soon as I hit the first small town.  I got gas in Delta Junction and then continued on towards Fairbanks...and towards the towering grey skies off to the west.  A few sprinkles here, a few there, and then wham!...I drove straight into the side of a cloud.  It was literally on the ground and the rain inside of that thing was rain like I had never ridden through (nor possibly even driven through in my car).  I usually try to keep my speed up through the rain so as to use the wind to clear the w
ater off my face mask.  I decided it was time to abandon that strategy when I could no longer see the road.  It was all water...water on the road, water in my face, water in the sky....all water.  I held on, covered up motocompy as best I could and prayed that my bike wouldn't hydroplane.  It didn't and I made it through to the other side where, to my surprise, were some of the bluest skies I'd seen on the trip thus far.  Weird.  I stopped and looked back at the cloud and thanked God that I hadn't left parts of the bike or myself back there.  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/184573893/"><img style="FLOAT: left" height="100" alt="Cloud Meets Ground" src="http://static.flickr.com/71/184573893_8440adefdb_t.jpg" width="75" /></a>The rest of the ride was a nice one and the landscape became more populated and tame as I neared the city.  Some of the longest, straightest roads I've ever seen (also in the video, sped up 4x).  As the title of the post suggests, it was along this stretch where a dragonfly flew square into the center of my visor.  It made me wonder how the guys with open faced helmets do it...I asked my girlfriend the same thing and she informed that it's because they're real men.  Hmmmm...interesting.  I spent the night at an Air Force Base Lodge near the town of North Pole, AK, and enjoyed the nice hotel room feel at camping prices.  Thanks Air Force.  You really put the "all that you can be" into "Be all that you can be".  I road into Fairbanks yesterday morning and had breakfast at Deb's (which included reindeer sausage) while my bike had its 12,000 mile maintenance done.  It had a great diner feel to it and I enjoyed talking to the waitresses and having a nice cup of diner coffee.  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/185315481/"><img style="FLOAT: right" height="75" alt="Breakfast at Deb's" src="http://static.flickr.com/77/185315481_2aea1080de_t.jpg" width="100" /></a> The bike got done early and I spent the rest
 of the day seeing the "sights" in Fairbanks.  It's an interesting place that seems to find its present identity in its past.  I went to Pioneer Park first and learnt me a bit of Alaskan History.  I then headed downtown to get some information on the city.  The most help I got wasn't at the Visitor's Center, however.  It was at the Ebony and Ivory Convenience store.  I really enjoyed talking with the owner and his son.  At their recommendation I headed out to the University of Alaska Museum, and man was it worth it.  It's an incredible museum, both inside and outside.  The architecture is beautiful and the paintings, photos, artifacts, fossils, and people inside were even better.  Very highly recommended.  I finished out the day with a dinner at the Elf's Den in North Pole and a night of typing this while my laundry dries.  Today I head north for the final push to Deadhorse.  It should be an interesting ride...now it's not only a gravel road that I have to deal with, but it's a gravel road which has sharp rocks mixed in.  Fun.  Why do people climb mountains?...Yeah, same sort of deal.</p>
<p>Pictures from the day in Fairbanks.  GPS upload is being slow...I'll try to post it later on.  Oh, and a few things I keep forgetting to write about.  One, I saw a fox and a couple of owls in the last few days.  Second, I saw a sign in the Yukon that said, "You are now leaving the 911 service area."  Hmmmm...</p>

<p>I wish I could stay up late and write for a long time, but it's already later 
than I should be up and I have a long ride tomorrow.  Long and short 
of it is this:  I got to Coldfoot yesterday evening after a long, sometimes 
harrowing ride through anything and everthing (mud was my favorite), camped 
there, got up this morning and road (again, through anything and everything) to 
Deadhorse, AK.  I got a flat tire about 50 miles north of Coldfoot which 
was no fun.  I had the stuff to patch it, though, and was back on the road 
in about 20 minutes or so.  Got up here around 4ish and took a tour of the 
oil fields which ended up at the northern coast, where I took a 
<strong>quick</strong> swim.  Air temp was 31 with windchill and the water 
was about 34.  Refreshing.  Anyways, I have so many pictures and 
photos to share from the last two days but sadly, it must wait.  Today 
was a good one and it represents the the culmination of  many months 
of planning and thinking.  I'm glad you all could share it with me.  
I'll post more on it later, but for now you can check out some pictures that I 
put on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/">Flickr</a>.  
More later.</p>]]>

			<title>July 12: Dalton Broke My Keyboard</title>

				<![CDATA[
<p>"Aieeeeeee!  Motocompy es muerto!"  That was my thought as I pushed 
the power button and received a SYSTEM DISK ERROR.  I've had problems with 
the computer before, but system disk stuff usually means death.  The story 
ends up well, but let me first tell you how I came to this point.  Two 
words: Dalton Highway.  The Dalton Highway, also known as Alaska State 
Route 11, is a road that leads from just north of Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay, 
takes you through some of the most beautiful terrain you'll ever see, and will 
never feel the soft touch of my motorcycle's tires again.  I can't remember 
three more challenging and rewarding days than the three that took me up 
and back on the Dalton Highway.  I'll shall now try to summarize those days 
and the events that transpired therein.</p>
<p>I left Eielson AFB on the morning of the 9th and drove northwest up AK-2 to 
the point where it meets up with the Dalton Highway, some 80 miles north of 
Fairbanks.  The whole time I was wondering what I was going to be met 
with.  I had heard and read so much about this road that it had almost 
reach mythical proportions for me.  I finally got there and the gravel 
greeted me cheerily as if to say, "Don't worry, you've ridden on gravel before, 
this won't be a problem for you...(sinister laugh under breath)".  Indeed, 
I had ridden on gravel before and I felt fairly confident in my
 abilities to 
navigate said road surface.  The Dalton Highway broke me, and my bike, and 
my computer, and nearly my spirit.  I can't count how many times I was 
certain I was going to crash/drop the bike/get a flat, etc.  I pulled into 
Coldfoot, AK, that afternoon desiring only two things: time away from my bike 
and a beer.  I found both.    The next day was even more 
difficult and beautiful.  I already told you all about the flat tire, but I 
didn't tell you about the rain or the mud, or the crazy potholes, or the 
dramatic temperature drop to below freezing as I road across the barren tundra 
leading up to the coast.   The ride was certainly difficult but was 
also beautiful and even fun, at times.  I would be frustrated and tired, 
concentrating on the road and nothing else, when suddenly I was met with 
something that didn't seem to fit in with my exasperation: a rainbow, fireweed 
(which is a purple flower that comes up in areas where there's been a fire), 
a powerful river like the Yukon, or an amazing mountain in the 
distance.   It was as though God was giving me signs to help me 
break through my current frustration and appreciate everything around me. I 
crossed the Arctic Circle on the 9th and pass through the Brooks Range on the 
10th.  Atigun Pass divides the vast coastal tundra plains and the inland 
boreal forest, and is both beautiful and eerie in its color and shape.</p>
<p>Hmmm...Ok, I'm starting to get long winded with this.  Let me try to 
speed things up a bit.  Sooooo, I road to Coldfoot on the first day.  
Highlites from this ride: Yukon River, Arctic Circle (there was a sign posted 
here about a wolf nearby that had attacked a woman...I found out later that the 
same wolf had tried to run down a guy on a motorcycle), and fireweed.  The 
next day I woke up early, after trying to sleep through the lack of darkness, 
the presence of rain, and the intermittent yelping from the Mush Team Huskies in 
the woods nearby.  Fifty miles north of Coldfoot is where I got my flat, 
bu
t just after that is when I got to Atigun Pass and then started descending 
towards the coast.  The crazy thing about this road is that there will be 
brief spots of decent asphalt or hard packed/sealed gravel...just enough to lull 
you into thinking that the worst is behind you and then, wham! potholes 
a'plenty.  On more than one occasion I would hit potholes large enough to 
nearly shake the handlebars out of my hands.  Highlites of the second day: 
Atigun Pass, beautiful blue skies with lush green tundra beneath (it reminded me 
of the Windows XP default desktop picture with the clouds and rolling 
hills...just way cooler and not so digital).  I stayed at the Prudhoe Bay 
Hotel there in Deadhorse...a first rate establishment, sortof.  Deadhorse 
exists only to support the oilfields up there and there are no actual residents, 
just temporary workers.  I stayed where they stay.  The Arctic Ocean 
was cold, (imagine that?) but it was fun to get in and join the Arctic Polar 
Bear club.</p>
<p>I met another couple of bikers that day, Andy and Scott, from Ontario, 
Canada.  They were on sport bikes, also not very suited for the 
dirt/gravel/mud road, and we decided to all ride back together the next day and 
to ride all the way back to Fairbanks, skipping the overnight in Coldfoot.  
We were all ready to be done with the Dalton.  Scott and Andy were 
great guys and were just starting an <a href="http://www.ironbutt.com/about/default.cfm">Iron Butt</a> challenge to 
drive from Deadhorse, AK, to Key West, FL.  We began our ride the next 
day at about 10:45 and quickly put a good amount of miles behind us.  Then 
the rain set in.  A few equations here: If "Rain + dirt and gravel = mud" 
and "mud + motorcycle without dirt bike tires = instability" then "brian + mud = 
unhappily unstable".  Check me on that...my algebraic rules might be a bit 
off, but you get the point.  Scott and I nearly went down on a number of 
occasions.  I was right behind him and every time I saw his back tire 
fishtail I would br
ace myself because I knew I was next.  Apart from the 
mud, the roads were in much better condition than they were the day 
before.  The road crews are constantly wetting and grading the roads (fun 
if you get behind the wetting truck...see above equations) and things were much 
smoother for our trip back.  We pulled back into Fairbanks at about 4am and 
promptly went to sleep.  The 24-hour sunlight helps for making long rides 
like that but it seemed to hit us all at once.  The day wasn't all easy, 
though.  Scott's bike kept overheating because his radiator was packed with 
mud.  Andy got a flat.  Motocompy got beaten to a pulp and stopped 
working.  I had to take him completely apart at Coldfoot and when I did I 
found numerous loose or missing screws, and a disconnected hard drive.  I 
pulled out the keyboard later on and found two of the keys had been shaken 
off.  All in all, the damage done by Dalton to myself or the other folks on 
bikes that I came into contact with on my trip up amounted to: 2 flat 
tires, a cracked crank case, and some cracked handle bars (from when 
one guy went down.  He was OK, just got caught in some 
mud).   That's all in a three day period... We woke up after our long 
ride, ate breakfast and took our bikes to a car wash to pressure wash all the 
mud off of the radiators, exhaust systems, lights...everything.  That took 
a fair amount of time but when we were done we said our goodbyes and parted 
ways, Andy and Scott were heading for Whitehorse in Canada and I pointed my 
newly cleaned bike towards Denali.  It was a good ride down there (I mean, 
heck, the entire road was paved) and the park was beautiful,  I couldn't 
actually see Mt. McKinley from the 75 mile viewpoint because of the weather, but 
I did see some beautiful landscape and a moose.  I spent the night in 
Cantwell Junction and am heading out onto the Denali highway shortly...yet 
another gravel road, but this one should be a bit shorter and better 
maintained.</p>
<p>Ok, so I could write or talk about
 this experience for much longer, but my 
guess is that it's much more interesting to me since it's so fresh and vivid in 
my mind's eye and that my lame description isn't going to quite do it 
justice.  Anyways, here's some pictures from those few days (more on my 
Flickr page) as well as a video from our passage of Atigun.  Most of my 
other videos would make you sick from all the shaking and bouncing around.  
Plus, there was usually mud, dust or rain stuck to my windshield...or the camera 
was shaken off of its mount.  Not the best conditions for movie 
production.  One more video from the Arctic coast.  Notice the 
weird layer of clouds that comes down to just above the horizon.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>
</p><p>I've seen so many amazingly beautiful things in the last few weeks that I 
think I'm becoming desensitized.  Oh, there's another lake with mist coming 
off of it.  Oh, there's another river with powerful rapids.  Oh, 
there's another snow-capped mountain range.  But today, I saw a new one for 
this trip, a glacier.  I wasn't really expecting to see it, and that was 
the cool part.  A watched pot never boils and an expected glacier 
never...um...moves.</p>
<p>I had planned on waking up early (yeah right) and heading east on the Denali 
Highway, a mostly-gravel road that travels east-west and links up AK-3 and 
AK-4.  It's supposed to be in a good condition and my dad had read that 
it's supposed to show you what Alaska used to look like.  I was looking 
forward to the trip, that is, until I woke up and heard rain outside my 
window.  Dirt/gravel roads + rain = mud...yeah, you remember. I decided to 
at least drive up a little ways and see how bad it was, but after fishtailing 
twice I said, "No thank you" and turned around.  There was another 
route to where I wanted to go, and I'd ridden on about as much mud as I could 
stand for one trip. Yeah, I know, I'm a big sissy...</p>
<p>As I took the road south towards Anchorage, I went in and out of rain, and 
almost caught a view of Mt. McKinley off in the distance.  For being the 
tallest peak in North America, and having the greatest rise f
rom base to peak in 
the world, it sure is an elusive bugger. I drove through Wasilla and turned east 
onto AK-1, the Glenn Highway.  I didn't really know what to expect from 
this section as I hadn't really planned on coming this way, but I was blown 
away, (almost literally).  The views were spectacular, starting with 
Hatcher Pass and ending with views of Wrangell-St. Elias in the distance.  
The highlite of this run was the Matanuska Glacier.  Glaciers are 
incredible things and no matter how many times you've seen one in person, you 
still can't help but wonder at it's immense size, power and history.  They 
shape, carve and otherwise alter the landscape like slow motion wood 
carving.  (The glacier near Kluane Lake in the Yukon actually altered the 
flow of it, turning its inlet into an outlet.)  I've been on and near 
glaciers in the past but am still struck by the sight of them.  The not so 
fun part of this journey was the rain.  I caught some pretty good 
downpours, one of which set in as I was waiting in line at a construction 
site.  </p>
<p>After I passed the glacier I entered a wide open stretch where the winds were 
so strong I had to lean into them to maintain a straight line.  Normally on 
bikes you lean only when you want to turn...here it was like I was in one, 
constant, straight turn.  As I neared Glennallen at the end of AK-1, I came 
across two not so pleasant things.  First, I saw a large, black wall of 
rain up ahead...(great, that should be fun), and second, I passed a scene where 
a moose had just been hit.  Nothing gory...just sad.  They get 
confused when the get on the road and don't know what to do with cars.  
With thunder and lighting up ahead, I began a race to Glennallen in the hopes 
that I would make it there before the rain set in heavy.  I lost.  I 
finally found a gas station to wait out the worst of it and ended up sticking 
around the town for a dinner.  I met, and ended up having a great 
conversation with a couple from Salt Lake City.  There names were Wa
yne and 
Ellen and they were gracious enough to invite me over to their table after we 
had all eaten.  We had the common bond of a nice, but slow and forgetful 
waitress.  (I've met so many great people on this trip...Wayne and Ellen, 
Jerry and Mary Ellen on the Dalton Highway, Scott and Andy, Adam, Rick at the 
B&amp;B in Cantwell (I hope I remembered his name right...I'm terrible with 
names), David and his Dad down in Fairbanks, the guy at the Coldfoot visitor's 
center (see, I can't remember his name), and so many more.  If any of you 
are reading this, thanks for making my trip so much fun, and may your own 
adventures be good and safe.)</p>
<p>So, now I'm at a little, one-room cabin near Wrangell-St. Elias, typing this 
out and hoping that the park will be rain free in the morning.  I'm going 
to post this in a second and then maybe write another one in the morning, 
addressing some of the questions I've received here but haven't answered.  
Also, I was thinking it would be fun to have a little "Ask the Biker" deal where 
you can ask questions about what making a trip on a bike is like, i.e. "what do 
you do when you have to sneeze?" or "does your butt ever go numb?" or "how are 
you so ruggedly good looking?"...things like that.  So, ask away, and I'll 
try to respond promptly.  Video of the Glacier below, as well as pictures 
from the drive.  Oh, and I added the video to yesterday's post...and, 
I think I'll be in Canada tomorrow night so I'm not sure how often the 
posts will be coming at that point.  Thanks again for reading and sharing 
my trip with me.  I can't answer all your comments but I do read them, and 
laugh at most, except for the ones that aren't funny.  Those ones cause me 
to cry.  </p>

				<![CDATA[<a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/190896106/"><img style="float: left;" alt="Wrangell Mountains" src="http://static.flickr.com/78/190896106_fcc878b816_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a>It's 
about 9:20am on the 16th and I should be on the road.  I'm in Whitehorse, 
Yukon, and apparently Whitehorsian alarm clocks function differently than others 
I've used in the past.  I set it for 7 so that I could wake up and do some 
laundry before I left (believe me, I <em>really</em> needed to do laundry) and 
now it looks like I won't be out of here until about 11.  Maybe that's 
alright, though, because the sleep felt great. 
<p>I've ridden through my fair share of rain, and consequently mud, the last few 
days.  I've also seen some amazing things and met some great people.  
I started the 14th near Wrangell-St. Elias and, after having an amazing 
breakfast sandwich made by the cabin host, Patty, I went back to my cabin to get 
my things ready to go.  As I was shutting down motocompy to take him to the 
bike, I unplugged the mouse and touched the screen and...nothing.  Checked 
a few things and...nothing.  Called my brother, Jon, and talked through the 
problem and...nothing.  So, Motocompy is now a bit crippled.  I have 
the mouse plugged in at all times and in order to perform most functions I need 
to pull over and click around a bit.  Oh well, maybe that's for the 
best.  After wrestling with that for a bit I jumped on the bike and headed 
towards the park.</p>
<p>Wrangell is, according to some Alaskans, the most beautiful section of 
Alaska.  It is, according to me, much less busy and touristy than Denali 
and that's a plus.  Sadly, I will never be able to really comment on its 
relative beauty as I only made it about a mile
 into the park.  I road over 
the Copper River, got a little ways in and found myself riding in soft mounds of 
dirt.  Hard gravel is OK...soft dirt isn't.  I decided to turn around 
and leave and got stuck in the process.  I couldn't get off the bike or it 
would have tipped over (I didn't have enough room to put the side stand 
down) so I had to wait for some other folks to come and help give me a 
push.  Riding next to Wrangell was amazing though and I got some great 
views of the snow-capped mountains which dominate that landscape.  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/190896232/"><img style="float: right;" alt="Construction" src="http://static.flickr.com/52/190896232_076dd0563b_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a>The 
not so fun part of this ride was the construction.  I think I ended up 
waiting for about an hour at various sites.  On a scale of "1" to "Awesome", I give Alaska's roads a "Rather Poor".  I made it through and 
found myself in Tok, AK.  (Someone told me that Tok got it's name from the 
Army Corps of Engineers during WWII.  It used to be called Tokyo 
Junction...they didn't like that so much so they took the "oyo" off.).  I 
had dinner with a couple of other bikers in Tok, Jim and Jan.  They're up 
from Colorado, touring around Alaska.  Good dinner, great conversation.</p>
<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/190896736/"><img style="float: left;" alt="Fire" src="http://static.flickr.com/63/190896736_81387c2243_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a>I 
haven't wanted to cover the same roads on my way back as on the way up, so I 
turned north towards Chicken, AK, and Dawson, YT.  Plus, my girlfriend was 
named after a teacher who moved to Chicken in the twenties to teach the local 
children, so I was somewhat obligated to go there.  The ride up was strange 
but beautiful.  Forest fires had devastated much of that area and the vast 
areas of burnt forests made for an interesting view.  Oh, and the fires are 
s
till going.  I road through an area that was burning.  No fire crews, 
no traffic adjustments, just signs that said "Slow Down" and "Limited 
Visibility".</p>
<p>I pulled into Chicken late that night and what an experience that ended up 
being.  I parked in front of the row of three shops they had and found a 
group of guys standing outside of the saloon.  I found out quickly that 
they were all bikers who had ended up there on the same night and were standing 
around talking and drinking some beer.  I had a great time talking with 
them all, sharing stories and finding out who they were and where they were 
from.  Chicken is strange...no other way to put it.  The public 
restrooms have a sign above the door that reads "Chicken Poop", and the Saloon 
has a tradition of collecting articles of women's nickers, placing them in a 
small canon packed with black powder, blowing them up and then pinning the 
remains to the ceiling inside.  Video below to prove it.  Strange.</p>
<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/190896857/"><img style="float: right;" alt="Chicken" src="http://static.flickr.com/71/190896857_f227ddc92c_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a>I 
woke up early, took a quick tour of the area, which included a view of the old 
schoolhouse and the "massive" post office.  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/190897287/"><img style="float: left;" alt="Schoolhouse" src="http://static.flickr.com/52/190897287_ef0ad52ac9_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a>My 
mission in Chicken complete (and then some), I headed east on the dirt/gravel 
"Top of the World Highway".  Rain quickly turned the road to mud and I 
found it slow going for the first hour or so.  This section of road took me 
across the border (where someone backed into me...nothing serious), and lends 
some amazing views of mountains, canyons, forests, and...gravel roads.  I 
made it through, though, and found myself at the banks of the Yukon, waiting for 
the ferry to
 take me into Dawson.   The ferry was a fun experience and 
I probably would have spent a bit of time in Dawson had it not been 
raining.  It was raining, however, and I pushed on for Whitehorse, some 330 
miles to the south.  It rained pretty hard on the trip down, until I made 
it to Carmacks where the sun took over and I was a very happy man, riding 
on well-paved roads in the sun.</p>
<p>I pulled into Whitehorse last night, had some dinner, thought about 
working on my post, and decided to go to bed instead.  My load of 
laundry should be done soon, so I should get moving.  I'll try to post 
something later today, but no promises...I'm in Canada, eh.  My cell 
phone costs a bit.  Lots more pictures of Flickr. GPS upload is again being 
amazingly slow, so none this time.  Hopefully more later on. </p>

<p>I'm sitting in a laundromat at a campground in Toad River, BC.  It's in 
the middle of nowhere but somehow they have an internet station, which just so 
happens to be in their laundromat, and I'm going to plug their interweb cable 
into Motocompy and give it a whirl.  No Wifi, no cell phone...I find a 
way!</p>
<p>So in eleven days I will be home, so the title of this post could come from 
that...but it doesn't.  I road from Whitehorse, YT, to Toad River, BC, 
today and had not a single drop of rain...not one!  That hasn't happened 
for eleven days.  Eleven days!  It was so nice to see and feel the 
sun.  I had clouds for good portions of the ride, but the clouds didn't 
rain on my parade...um, sorry for that.  What did rain on my parade 
slightly was some good ol' fashioned Whitehorse thievery.  I walked out to 
my bike this morning and found it coverless.  They didn't take anything 
else...my tent, sleeping bag, camelback...not even the bag for the cover.  
Just the cover.  Stinky.</p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/191516646/"><img style="float: right;" alt="Sign Post Forest" src="http://static.flickr.com/51/191516646_27aaeb1513_t.jpg" h
eight="75" width="100" /></a> 
<p>The ride from Whitehorse to Fireside was pretty uninteresting.  I think 
I'm a bit jaded and desensitized to beauty at this point.  I've seen so 
much in the last month, and driving down roads that I had already been on during 
this trip just wasn't too exciting.  But, no rain and no 
mud/gravel/potholes...I was happy.  I did cross over "Brook's Brook" and 
"George's Gorge"...thought those were a bit funny.  I also drove through 
Watson Lake, which is a town of some smart folks.  They figured out that if 
you don't have any natural tourist attraction, you should just make one, 
especially if it's one that you don't have to maintain.  They have what's 
called a "Sign Post Forest" and it's a place where people 
from around the globe have stopped to tack up their own, unique 
signs.  Fascinating.</p>
<p>I stopped for gas and a bite to eat in Fireside, BC, and started back out on 
the road.  These last 110 miles have been some amazing ones.  I'm back 
in the mountains, which I really dig, and the wildlife I saw today was much more 
than the rest of the trip combined.  Bears, buffalo, wild horses (who's 
gonna ride them?), moose (one just ran through the campsite next to mine), deer 
(or dear...whichever you prefer), and even a roadkill porcupine.  I road by 
Muncho Lake, which aside from having a great name, is one of the largest natural 
lakes in North America and sits right at the beginning of The Rockies, which 
span 1,850 miles through Canada and the U.S. down into New Mexico.  Maybe 
I'll see the bottom of them some time later on in this trip.</p>
<p>Ok, one quick funny story before I call it quits.  As I was arriving 
here in Toad River, I saw a camping area and decided to pull off into it.  
I applied the brakes, whilst entering the gravel drive...you see what's 
coming.  Both tires locked up and started skidding and I was heading 
towards a short drop-off into a grassy area below.  The bike started to tip 
and I was sure it was going over.  I came down the shor
t slope, up a bank, 
and somehow came to a stop in the grass...no harm done.  I couldn't believe 
I hadn't dumped the bike.  Crazy.  Picture of my 9.8 landing 
below.  (The German judge docked me for the bugs on the windshield).  
Speaking of bugs on the windshield...none of my bike video came out too clear 
through the mess of mosquito guts, so only video from my camera...of my awesome 
riding skillz.  GPS <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/16jul06pt1.htm">here</a>...<a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/16jul06pt2.htm">here</a>...and <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/16jul06pt3.htm">HERE</a>!!!! More pictures

<p>First off, the <a href="http://www.on10.net/">www.on10.net</a> interview is up (just went live today) and you can check it out <a href="http://www.on10.net/blogs/theshow/3919/">here</a>!  It was really fun to meet Tina and talk through the project and my trip.  Hope you all like it.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /?><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>I'm in Edmonton right now...Wasn't really planning on stopping in Edmonton, but on my way from Grand Prairie yesterday I stopped and took a quick gander at my rear tire and saw some metal wires starting to poke through.  Not the safest for long trips (or any trips for that matter), so I decided to make a quick stop here to get that taken care of as well as a routine service
 before I push on towards Yellowstone.  So, that tire lasted me all of 17 days and 6300 miles...ouch.  I imagine Alaska's gravel roads can't have helped all that much.</p>
<p>I'm sitting in the dealership right now using their computer so I can't do anything too fancy, and honestly, there hasn't been all that much to write about in the last few days (that's why I'm using a picture from the previous day).  <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /?><st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alberta</st1:place></st1:state> is a fine enough place, but after seeing what I've seen further north it's hard to get excited about the hay bails and long, straight highways.  There's an actual nighttime here, though, and that's a plus.  Also, the mosquitoes have left me alone and that's another huge bonus.  I can't begin to describe how many mosquitoes I have smashed on the front of my bike.  Lovely.  There are gigantic hordes of them in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alaska</st1:place></st1:state>, especially further north, and they swarm to the heat of the bike as soon as you stop.  Two interesting/funny things from yesterday: I saw a reindeer farm.  After being so happy to see a couple on my drive, stopping and taking pictures, and acting like a total tourist, I then see a whole field of them right on the highway...nice.  Second, <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alberta</st1:place></st1:state> posts these funny signs that show an outline of someone holding binoculars and the statement "Watchable Wildlife" printed above.  I don't know why but that made me chuckle.  I wonder which ones are more watchable...the caribou or the reindeer?  Maybe they have competitions.  Anyways...<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>I should be in the States tonight and then visiting friends and family in Yellowstone and then <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place></st1:state>.  This is Brian, signing off from the land of "eh's" and "aboots".  Beautiful country...nice folk
s.  Come to Canada if you never have before.  More later.</p>?&gt;]]>

				<![CDATA[<a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/194738433/"><img style="float: left;" alt="Hot Sun" src="http://static.flickr.com/69/194738433_cb2ee51535_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> 
<p>I'm in West Yellowstone, MT, getting ready to head south...on the homestretch 
of this little voyage.  These last few days have been some of the best of 
the trip and it's hard to pack up and get back on the road.  The next few 
will be really good as well, though, so I certainly can't complain.  
Anyways, let me tell you how I got here and then try, and I do mean 
<em>try</em>, to describe my day in Y
ellowstone yesterday.</p>
<p>I got my bike back from the shop in Edmonton at around 3:30 and jumped on the 
road towards Calgary.  By the way, if you ride a bike and are in Edmonton, 
stop at Alberta Cycle Motorsports.  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/194738261/"><img style="float: right;" alt="Cleaning" src="http://static.flickr.com/62/194738261_aa99c8fb1e_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a>They 
were incredible, going far beyond what they needed to do for a tire 
installation/service.  They washed my bike and made it look nearly 
new...free of charge.  Mike, the owner, powerwashed a ton of mud out of the 
radiator and personally scrubbed down the bike.  I had forgotten that the 
windshield was actually transparent back when I had left San Diego.  I road 
from Edmonton to Calgary as fast as I (legally) could, ate dinner, gassed up, 
and got back on the road.  By the way, Calgary isn't the best place for 
Mexican food.  Hmmm...imagine that.  The sun started going down and 
before I knew it, it was dark and I actually had to use my lights.  The 
sunset over the farms was beautiful and I enjoyed watching the migratory birds 
flying south.  I couldn't help thinking that I was on my own little 
southern migration, although I wasn't flying...yet.  The sky dimmed and the 
bugs came out...in force.  Turning on my high beams was a frightening 
experience as it would suddenly illuminate the multitude of creatures rushing 
towards their doom on the front of my bike, helmet, boots, pants, jacket, 
etc.  It was so bad that I had to pull over and spend nearly ten minutes 
cleaning up...not as a convenience but more out of necessity.  I crossed 
the border pretty late and was greeted by the Montana welcome sign and the 
welcome 75mph sign.  That's when <em>I</em> began flying.  I pulled 
into Great Falls, MT, at about 2am and got a few hours of much needed 
sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning I woke up, checked out of my hotel, and hit the road towards 
Helena, MT.  The ride
 was very nice, and different from the rest of 
the trip...fields, mountains, plateaus, and sun...lots of it.  It was in 
the 90's which made me laugh...a week and a half before I had been riding in 
freezing conditions and now I was sweating in the unhindered sun of the Big 
Sky Country.  I road to West Yellowstone, through the Gallatin Canyon, and 
arrived in the late afternoon.  Since then, I have been spoiled 
rotten.  My friends here live in a gigantic house.  It's not 
extravagant, but it's beautiful and has an incredible view of Hebgen Lake to the 
south and Yellowstone National Park to the East.  It's a house that 
none of us would ever be able to afford had it been built in 
California  My bed is incredible, the food they've given me has been 
exceptional, and it's been so nice to spend the time with them..just a very 
welcoming family.  They took me to breakfast yesterday and then out to 
Quake Lake, which was formed by a massive earthquake some fifty years ago.  
The quake caused an incredible landslide that dammed the river 
below creating a lake where forest used to be.  It's strange to see 
the trees sticking out of the water, but the whole area is beautiful.  
Breakfast was great, although the restaurant didn't allow a mix of bacon and 
sausage...it was one or the other.  I almost felt ashamed for asking.</p>
<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/195455260/"><img style="float: left;" alt="Beehive Geyeser" src="http://static.flickr.com/68/195455260_ad6e7314f0_t.jpg" height="100" width="75" /></a>Yellowstone is a massive, beautiful, and naturally impressive part 
of this country and if you've never been here then you need to plan a trip 
soon.  Old Faithful is great but is such a small part of the 
park.  The geysers, rivers, waterfalls, canyons, elk, deer, bison, meadows, 
mountains, lakes, and forests can't be captured in pictures (although I took 202 
of them before my battery died), nor can they adequately be described in 
words...and I only sa
w a small portion of the park yesterday  You just need 
to come here, and plan on spending at least 2 or 3 days, minimum.  We were 
lucky enough to visit on a day when Beehive Geyser blew and that was extremely 
impressive...powerful and loud.  The colors in the water, trees, rocks, and 
grass were more than my little camera could take in, and the herds of bison and 
elk are much more massive than can be appreciated in two dimensions.  Come 
to this park!  I'm about to plan a return trip myself.</p>
<p>Ok, I need to get on the road, but hopefully I'll get a chance to post later 
today from Utah.  Video of some of my drive to Yellowstone is below, as 
well as a few pictures.  More on Flickr...but less than can show you 
what I've seen here.  My words don't do the park or this family 
justice.  The trip continues to be great...this country fascinates me.</p>

				<![CDATA[<a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/198051396/"></a>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/198051396/"><font color="#000080"><img alt="Welcome to AZ" src="http://static.flickr.com/64/198051396_a9e1356d97_t.jpg" name="graphics1" align="left" border="1" height="75" width="100" /></font></a>I'm sitting in my 
(last-of-the-trip) hotel room here in Page, AZ, looking at pictures from the 
last few days and listening to the news in the background.  I haven't 
followed things quite as closely as I normally do over the last month and a half 
and it's interesting to catch up on things...there's much to catch up on.  
And, much has happened in the last few days here, but I'm mostly going to let 
the pictures tell the story so that I can get out of here
.  I'm heading to 
the Grand Canyon today and I'd like to leave myself as much time there as 
possible.</p>
<p>I left West Yellowstone on the 22nd, drove back through the park and down 
into the Grand Tetons.  I think the most impressive thing about the Grand 
Tetons is how they stand out in stark contrast to everything else around 
them.  They're part of a range, but they tower over the other mountains and 
certainly over the vast plains below them.  The lakes at their base are 
clear and blue and I'm told that on a calm day (which the 22nd wasn't) they 
perfectly reflect the peaks above them.  I drove out of the park, through 
the rest of Wyoming, into Idaho and finally down into Utah.  The 
temperature rose as I traveled south, reaching 97 in Jackson, WY, and 101 in 
Afton, WY...not fun when you're on a bike.  It's not too bad when you're 
moving, but sitting at stoplights (like I had to in Jackson) makes for a hot 
bike and a hot body...a different kindof hot than I normally have, that 
is.  Parts of this drive went through canyons but most of it was through 
open prairie and the contrast was very interesting.  The little towns that 
spring up out of nowhere often have much more character than their "Population 
100" sign would indicate...and they'd better if they're going to make me slow 
down to 35mph whilst transiting through their character-laden streets.</p>
<p>I spent a few great days with my Aunt and Uncle and Grandma and Grandpa in 
Spanish Fork, UT, enjoying the chance to be with family and to relax a 
bit.  It was hot the whole time (106 in Provo) but I didn't mind all that 
much.  It would have been a different story had I been camping.  I 
left yesterday morning and began the drive down I-15 towards southern 
Utah.  Again, the temperature rose as I drove south and I found myself 
stopping for water and shade much earlier than I would stop for food or 
gas.  One of the highlites of the entire trip came on yesterday's travels 
as I got to spend some time in Zion National Park.  This w
as yet another 
place that I've been to on this voyage where I immediately knew that I would 
need to make a return trip in order to adequately appreciate it in its 
entirety.  Beautiful.  Much of it is comprised of old, solidified sand 
dunes looking something like hardened cake batter which has been just been 
poured into a bowl.</p>
<p>I drove out of the park through its mile-long tunnel and off through the 
colorful deserts on my way to Arizona.  Thunderstorms with giant rain 
clouds and bright lightning strikes were everywhere but somehow I seemed to 
avoid them on this leg of the trip.  I got rained on several times earlier 
in the day and while I would have been frustrated by the rain about a week ago, 
I welcomed it in the midst of the 106 degree weather.  I guess it's all a 
matter of perspective.  Much like how driving the 35 minutes to my parent's 
house used to seem like a "long" drive before I took off on this trip and spent 
10-12 hours a day on the road.  Speaking of being on the road, I need to 
get out of here.  I hope you enjoy the pictures...they don't quite do 
reality justice, but it was fun to try.  Two more days...</p>
<p>(Oh, also...you may see some random "spam" comments left on my posts.  I 
try to delete them as soon as I see them, but please ignore them if you catch 
them before I do.  They're generally pretty bad...nothing I'd like my mom 
to have to read.  I'm guessing it's from an automated system, but if it's 
from a person and that person is reading this, then I can confidently tell you 
that none of us are interested in your naughty wares which you peddle.  Go 
peddle elsewheres.  Thank you.)</p>

				<![CDATA[<p align="center"><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/202129528/"><img alt="Grand Canyon View" src="http://static.flickr.com/59/202129528_c976f64fdd.jpg" height="78" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I just spent a long time on this post and then, through a technological 
foible, all was lost and I am back at square one.  Were this a different 
post I might be tempted to ditch it and hold off until the next time but I 
really want to cover the last few days of the trip, for a few reasons: 1.  I 
saw and experienced so many cool things, and 2.  I feel like I can't move 
on to other posts until I knock this one out.  So, I proceed to the 
knocking out of said post.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>As I traveled south from Canada I noticed many marked changes:  less 
hours of light, less bugs, more intense sunlight, more humidity, less trees, 
more sand, more vibrant colors, and more cars, just to name a few.  Having less 
sunlight means traveling in the dark at times and, while I'm not a big fan of 
riding at night, sometimes it's necessary.  I arrived in Page at night with 
only the city lights and broad lightning strikes in the distance to illuminate 
the landscape and didn't get much of an appreciation for the desert surrounding the 
city, nor <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">Lake</st1:placetype> 
<st1:placename w:st="on">Powell</st1:placename></st1:place> and the Glen Canyon 
Dam at the city's edge.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/642930
54@N00/203368774/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/76/203368774_91ebf6ef5d_t.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="Glen Canyon Dam" height="75" width="100" /></a>When I woke up on the morning of July 25th I was 
startled by the amount of color, the bright reds, pinks, oranges, corals and 
every mixture in between.  I had a very standard complimentary Continental 
breakfast while enjoying the very non-standard view through the window, loaded 
up my bike and hit the road like so many other mornings before.  I road 
back over the bridge to get a good daytime view and was amazed at how much I had 
missed in the night.  <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">Lake</st1:placetype> <st1:placename w:st="on">Powell</st1:placename></st1:place> is beautiful and would make for a 
great weekend vacation spot.  I turned back around on US-89 South and made 
my way towards the <st1:place w:st="on">Grand Canyon</st1:place>, some 130 miles 
to the southwest, as the motorcycle flies.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>The Colorado Plateau is home to the most National Parks in the nation and 
each one is beautiful and majestic in its own right, but the <st1:place w:st="on">Grand Canyon</st1:place> is truly the brightest diamond in a big bag 
o' beauties.  In some ways it was a fitting end to my travels, being the 
vastest and most majestic sight my motorcycle put me in front of throughout the 
entire six-week journey.  The sheer size of it is overwhelming, but couple 
that with the beauty of the river, rocks, plateaus, etc., and it becomes a 
spectacular creation which no human should miss in their brief stay on this 
planet.  Amazing.  I started on the east side of the South Rim which 
turned out to be not nearly as crowded as the western side, which is near the 
visitor's center, and slowly worked my way west.  The great (and 
somewhat frightening) thing about the <st1:place w:st="on">Grand 
Canyon</st1:place> is that they don't try to restrict your enjoyment of 
it.  The signs say "Your safety is your own r
esponsibility.  Don't 
underestimate the Canyon."  Translation: "If ya get hurt it's yer own fault 
cuz we already done told you to be careful."  I didn't underestimate the 
Canyon.  I climbed around on some of the rocks and made my way out to a 
small formation for some pictures, but didn't get too crazy.  <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/198863547/"><img style="float: left;" alt="Grand Canyon" src="http://static.flickr.com/31/198863547_156a3e7f07_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a>I 
would love to make a return trip to hike down into the canyon, possibly across 
to the North Rim.  The age and color of the rock the <st1:place w:st="on">Colorado River</st1:place> has cut its way through over the years 
varies greatly throughout the park and yields a dynamic display of multi-hued 
formations.  The rock the river is currently working on is extremely old 
and hard and has given up only the bare minimum that time has required of it, 
making for a very steep inner canyon.  They call it the "Canyon within the 
Canyon" and it would dwarf many of the world's other canyon's on its own, apart 
from the expansive soft rock sections towering above it.  It was difficult 
to wrap my mind around how large the Canyon was while seeing it in person, so 
let me throw out some numbers to help myself and maybe you, too:  The 
average distance between the North and South Rims is 10 miles...15 miles at it's 
widest.  The average depth is 4000 feet over its 277 mile length (nearly 6 
times the length of Rhode Island and longer than California is wide), 
and is over 6000 feet at its deepest section...over three and a 
half times the height of the <a href="http://www.skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=18">tallest building</a> 
in the world.  Don't underestimate the Canyon...</p>
<p>I spent about three hours at the Canyon, taking in the sights and wondering 
at the largeness of everything, before the lateness of the 
day required my<a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.
com/photos/64293054@N00/198863394/"><img style="float: right;" alt="AZ" src="http://static.flickr.com/62/198863394_c4e56f5e0f_t.jpg" height="75" width="100" /></a> 
departure.  I knew that I was leaving my last real destination of the trip 
and it was difficult.  From then on out it was only going to be driving and 
I would be home before I knew it...the trip was coming to an end.  I got on 
the bike and turned south towards the Prescott, AZ, area to spend the night with 
some friends.  The driving at this point in the journey was all long, flat, 
open roads requiring little technical skill and constant pressure on the 
throttle...an activity which can tire the right forearm when done for hours at a 
time.  Thankfully, I had purchased a <a href="http://www.throttlemeister.com/seeitwork.html">cruise control-like 
accessory</a> for the bike before I had left on the trip and it came in rather 
handy throughout this stretch of my travels.  I dodged thunderstorms on my 
way down to I-40 and enjoyed the smell of the recent rain on the 
thick pine needle bed which coated the forest floor.  The road 
teased me all day, alternately turning towards and away from the large storms in 
the distance.  I didn't get much in the way of rain until I came close to 
Prescott at which point the skies grew incredibly dark and the rain and 
lightning came down fast and furious.  It wasn't too bad, though, and I 
pulled up to the house with a pair of wet jeans as the day's only 
casualty.  It was great to see familiar faces and I was again spoiled by 
good food, a good internet connection, and, most importantly, great 
conversation.</p>
<p>I planned on getting on the road at about 9 the next morning but didn't leave 
until close to 11...now a familiar routine.  The waffles were worth it, 
though, and I hit the road with a full stomach, a rare occurrence throughout the 
previous month and a half of riding.  I jumped on US-89 South which turned 
out to be an incredibly enjoyable section of road full of sharp turns and 
well
-maintained roads, something I've learned to not take for granted after 
seeing every version of "poorly maintained" possible.  Video below...all 
sorts of fun.  My time on the 89 came to an end, as did the enjoyable, 
comfortable riding, and I spent the rest of the day riding west in stifling heat 
and oppressive humidity.  This truly was the most miserable riding weather 
I had encountered in the 39 days I had been away from home.  If it's cold, 
you put on more clothes.  If it's hot, you put on the mesh jacket and take 
off the waterproof pants.  If it's raining, you make sure you're wearing 
the waterproof pants and anything other than the mesh jacket.  If it's hot 
and muggy, you...suffer.  No fun.  I think the low point came as I 
descended down the hill into the Coachella valley...man, it was nasty.  I 
pulled up to my parents' house in Escondido wanting to get off of the bike and 
jump straight into the swimming pool.</p>
<p>It was great to see my parents.  They were such a help and 
encouragement to me on this trip and it was really fun to see how they had 
been following me on the map, circling the different places I had 
been.  My dad grilled some steaks and my mom made some veggies and 
salad...so good.  The pool erased the day's discomfort within seconds 
(video below) and the comfortable bed in my old bedroom was extremely 
welcome.  My dad made pancakes and bacon the next morning and I 
got on the road for the final time.  I was only 30 miles from my house, 
which I could have easily done the night before, but the evening with 
my parents was a true highlight of the trip...and for some silly reason 
I wanted to stick to my original arrival date of July 27.  I was 
surrounded by more cars than I was used to, traveling south on 
the 4-plus lanes of I-15 towards San Diego, and although the streets were all 
familiar to me I still felt like I was in the middle of my 
trip.  I think I felt that way until I pulled into my driveway, got off 
of my bike and saw the cat lounging at the door. 
 Home.  What a weird 
feeling...it took a while to set in.  I think it still is.</p>
<p>A few more posts to come...thanks again for all of your comments.  I'm 
glad you all have been enjoying this as much as I have.  I hope you will 
each have, or have had, the opportunity to experience this continent in a 
way similar to this trip.  It's so incredibly worth it.  Ok, all 
for now.  GPS files <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/26jul06pt1.htm">here</a>, <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/26jul06pt2.htm">here</a>, <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/26jul06pt3.htm">here</a>, <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/26jul06pt4.htm">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/27jul06.htm">here</a>.  More pictures

				<![CDATA[<p align="center"><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carotidbattery/218254386/"><img alt="Trip Start to Finish" src="http://static.flickr.com/75/218254386_924e80e3a0.jpg" height="412" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I've been home for three weeks now and I'm finding it difficult to 
believe that I was ever gone.  Life envelops so quickly and things seem 
just the same as when I left, just more hectic because I was gone for so long 
and didn't pay much attention to my home life.  It reminds me of
 my time on 
the ship, when I would leave for 6 month stints and come home to find that in 
some ways everything had changed, and in some ways nothing had changed.  
Either way it felt like I had never left and that the trip was all just a 
dream.  And so it is with this trip, except that while many of my memories 
from the 6 month deployments were ones that I didn't really care to keep, the 
majority of my memories from this trip are ones that I would love to keep fresh 
for years to come.  So, I suppose this will be my last post about the 
trip.  I have been meaning to write a few different ones, but I think I'll 
just consolidate it into one and call it a day.  You'll find my trip 
recounted by the numbers below, followed by a description of what went into the 
making of my posts, and then some final thoughts on the trip.  Thanks for 
reading.</p>

<p>Ok, so something my brother has been asking me to do is to describe what went 
into the making of my posts.  I kept meaning to write about this on the 
trip but didn't really find the time because I was usually busy with writing 
about the day's events and couldn't fit both topics in.  Now I have the 
time, though, so here goes:<br />-Throughout the day I would take pictures and 
videos of things that caught my eye or sections of road that I thought might be 
fun to record.<br />-I would find a place to stay and figure out what my internet 
situation was going to be (WIFI, cell phone, none).  This would drive what 
I would be able to upload.<br />So, assuming I had WIFI, I would proceed 
thusly:<br />-I would set up the computer in my tent or hotel room, charge up 
camera/phone/gps batteries, and download my pictures into <
a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a>.<br />-After looking through all the 
pictures I would pick out the ones I wanted to upload to Flickr and would use 
the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/">Flickr Uploader</a> to do 
so.<br />-While my pictures were uploading I would start looking at the video from 
the day, video from the bike and video from my camera.  Sections that 
looked interesting got earmarked for editing in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/default.mspx">Windows 
Movie Maker</a> where I would cut and combine them into maneagable bits, 
adding in fades and transitions where appropriate.  Once this was done I 
would start the upload into Youtube, a very time consuming task depending on the 
type of internet connection I had and the length of the video.<br />-Generally, 
while my pictures and videos were uploading I would open up the GPS recordings 
from the day.  My GPS files are full of standard NMEA sentences, such as 
this:</p>
<p>$GPGGA,030536.000,5955.5795,N,12905.8990,W,1,08,1.4,823.4,M,0.7,M,,0000*7F<br />$GPGSA,A,3,29,18,08,11,19,26,28,27,,,,,2.6,1.4,2.1*39<br />$GPGSV,3,1,09,28,79,152,28,29,52,259,31,26,52,273,34,08,50,124,33*72<br />$GPGSV,3,2,09,27,23,123,26,17,23,174,21,19,19,039,27,18,16,329,28*74<br />$GPGSV,3,3,09,11,16,091,14*4A<br />$GPRMC,030536.000,A,5955.5795,N,12905.8990,W,35.06,9.89,060706,,,A*45<br />$GPVTG,9.89,T,,M,35.06,N,64.9,K,A*0E</p>
<p>Not sure what all that means but those files would then be uploaded to <a href="http://www.GPSvisualizer.com">www.GPSvisualizer.com</a> so that they could 
be displayed graphically.  The problem here was that the maximum file size 
I could upload was 3MB and the files were often closer to 5MB.  That's why 
I would upload them in pieces and you would have to view them in three or more 
parts.  Once they were uploaded and displayed on top of a <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Map</a> I would have to go in and edit 
the code so that the page could be uploaded to my webserver and disp
layed with 
an address beginning with <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com">www.carotidbattery.com</a> instead of the 
gpsvisualizer.com prefix...(they only store the files for a short period of 
time).  This process always took a ton of time, too.  Their server 
wasn't the fastest and transferring big files over slow connections is always, 
well, slow.</p>
<p>So, at this point I have pictures, video and GPS logs uploaded...what's 
next?  Oh yeah, I guess I have to write something about the day to tie all 
of the visual elements together.  I would usually reach this point at about 
midnight, if I was lucky and the interweb ether was transferring my bits and 
bites quickly, but oftentimes it would be later and I wouldn't finish until 
close to 1 (if I finished at all).  Many times I would have to stop and 
finish the next morning (as I am currently considering doing with this post as 
it is now almost 12:30am...No! I must finish).  So, that's kindof how it 
would all come together and hopefully you can get an idea of why the whole thing 
was so time consuming.  I really wanted to respond to comments and answer 
questions, but it was an "either/or" decision between comments and posts...posts 
won.  </p>

<p>Ok...I'm sure that last section wasn't all that interesting to many of you so 
I'll cut the technical stuff off there and start up with some closing 
thoughts.  I'm going to keep this short because it could easily go on and 
on and on and....  </p>
<p>If you ever get a chance to take a large roadtrip like this, do it.  If 
you're scared of motorcycles, don't be...ride one at least once.  If you 
don't like Canadians (like some of my posters), start liking them...they're 
nice.  If you haven't been to Alaska, go.  If you haven't seen the 
Grand Canyon in person, do it.  If you
 used to enjoy photography but 
haven't done it in a while, get out your camera and take it with you in the car 
tomorrow.  If you can't drive thousands of miles, drive a hundred and see 
where it takes you.  I truly believe that I am a changed person because of 
this trip and I hope and wish that same type of experience for all of you.  
God has made an amazing world and it's worth exploring.  There's more than 
just buildings and houses out there and I think I had started to forget 
that.  I mean, just look at that map up there....Look how big this 
continent is.  Crazy!  Alright, I suppose that's all I have to 
say.  Thank you so much for following along on this trip.  It was an 
incredible experience for me and you all were such an important part of 
that.  Thanks again, and happy travels to you all.</p>
<p>(By the way, the website won't be going away.  I plan on keeping it up 
and posting new bits of randomness on it at times...and, who knows, maybe there 
will be another trip to take you all on...we'll stay in 
touch.)</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>I've been using <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> for 
managing/editing my pictures for a little while now.  It's a great program 
and it's free...hard to beat.  Anyways, I just saw recently that there's a 
new <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/">beta version</a> (a beta?...from 
Google?....no!) and the cool new feature here is the link to a new online album, 
similar to Flickr but with 250MB of storage.  I'm still monkeying around 
with it but it seems pretty cool.  The nice thing about Flickr is that you 
can embed a single image into your post.  So far I've only seen how to 
embed a link to a whole Picasa album (below) but hopefully they'll keep 
working on it.</p>

<p>Five years ago today I was onboard a US Navy Destroyer heading for Bahrain, a 
small island just north of Qatar in the Arabian (Persian) Gulf.  How time 
flies and lives change.  Through the broken images coming through over our 
satellite tv connection my friend, Andy, and I found out what the words I had 
heard a few hours earlier actually looked like.  I had been on watch 
earlier in the day when someone in another part of the ship called up and said, 
"Hey, a plane just flew into the World Trade Center."  I remember what 
came to mind...a small Cessna whose pilot had made a terrible mistake, clipping 
one of the towers and falling to the streets below.  A terrible image...one 
that unfortuna
tely fell far short of reality.  You all remember where you 
were...what you were doing.  I was on my way home, via Bahrain, the 
Seychelles, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Hawaii.  We never made it to Bahrain, 
nor any of the other ports, except for Hawaii.  I can't believe how much 
has happened in my own life over the past five years.  So much has changed, 
and the days and years keep passing.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be overly dramatic here...I actually just looked at my 
calendar a few minutes ago and saw the date, 9-11, and started thinking back on 
things.  I've been off the ship for coming up on two and a half years now 
but it seems like an eternity has passed since then.  I'm glad to be done 
with that part of my life, but I wouldn't trade the experiences for 
anything.  God blessed in hardship...something I hope I will come to 
understand more fully in the coming five years, and those to 
follow.</p>]]>

e my bike yesterday...the first time I'd ridden since I pulled it into my garage at the end of my trip, over two and a half months ago.  I hadn't ridden it since then because I was under the impression (from the dealership in Canada) that the bike would need a valve adjustment when I got back, and also because my garage had grown around the bike, enveloping it in a web of junk.  Well, I cleared up both issues this last week.  The valve adjustment doesn't come up for another 8k miles and I hacked the garage's overgrowth to free the bike for action.  It took me about a week to finally get the engine to turn over and breathe fire.  She was slow coming to life but seems to be running just fine, now.  It feels good to be back on the bike and it brings back memories of  the trip...good, exciting memories that transcend the morning commuter traffic.<br />]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>So I asked her to marry me on November 30th...it's now 12:22am on March 23rd and I'm finally getting around to writing something new.  My friend, JP, gave me some <strike>scathing criticism</strike> encouragement when he saw the lull in my interweb presence and that was just what I needed for inspiration.  I'm falling asleep as I begin this post so I know full well it won't be a long one.  Just wanted to write a quick update on the life of Brian.</p> <p>I remember hearing other guys talk about how busy their lives were in the time leading up to their wedding and thinking, "Come on...it can't be that bad.  Seriously, you're a guy...it's not like you have to pick out the sheets and towels, right?"  Now four months into engaged life, I realize how right and wrong I was.  No, I'm not picking out sheets and towels...but I'm present when 
all of those decisions are made.  Don't get me wrong, I give my input when it's requested/needed, and I'm not complaining about the process, I'm mostly just poking fun at myself for my past miscalculations.</p> <p>Actually, I think things have gone pretty well for trying to squeeze what I'm convinced should be three and a half years of wedding planning into the last four months.  On a scale of 1 to "Splendid", my fiancee comes in at a cool "Ridiculously Incredible"...I'd say she's a keeper.  (Now let's just hope she's saying the same thing about me...)  We've taken care of most of the major stuff and are now finalizing, ordering, planning, paying and calling the final touches of this wedding into existence.  Should be a lot of fun...</p> <p>Ok, I'm going to go to bed.  Oh, quickly, the reason for the post's title... I went up to Julian, CA, this last weekend and left my camera up there.  That's what I think, anyways, since it wasn't with me when I got back.  That <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2003_reviews/optios4.html">camera</a> had been all around the world with me...I'm sad to see it go.  I went ahead and ordered its updated <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0607/06072401pentaxoptios7.asp">descendant</a> earlier tonight, but in deference to my misplaced photographic companion I shall leave this post photoless.  Goodnight.</p>]]>

gh...except for the hour we lost in time zone changes.  Nothing too exciting from today, so I'll keep this short.  The rest of the week should be a ton of fun, though...hiking at Zion National Park tomorrow, Bryce Canyon National Park the following day, Grand Staircase the day after that, and the Grand Canyon to round things off.  I'm going to try to record the GPS of our hikes and will hopefully post that along with some pictures and videos from the days' adventures.  But it's time for bed now...seeya when I seeya.</p> <p>(One humorous P.S. to relay...when I was on the motorcycle trip I would post something on my blog and then talk to my (then) girlfriend shortly thereafter to see what she thought.  She would give me her general impressions and correct any mistakes, grammar or otherwise.  It's a lot easier to have my editor right here along with me...the corrections are more real-time.)</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Gadzooks!  It’s been over a year since my last real post.  I never intended such a sabbatical from the bloggery but a sabbatical was taken nonetheless.  I have had to be quite strategic with my time and writing these little sweet nothings was quickly placed upon the back burner as I began to learn the intricacies of married
 life, remodeling a house, remodeling a house while learning the intricacies of married life (two things that should never be mixed), starting a business while working full time, and the oddities of trying to live as close to normally while dealing with poor health.</p>
<p>Diving back into the blog, my intention is to find an outlet for my thoughts.  I have many interests (from technology to woodworking to motorcycling to life in a modern world) and I enjoy cataloging these things as they flit around in my brain.  Interspersed will be thoughts on life in general, and my life in specific.  Ok, so here goes…</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>Something that’s rattled around in my brain over the last several years is my (our) propensity to cling to things that will make us feel a bit bigger.  This election has yet again brought this concept to the forefront of my thinking.  It’s certainly not something unique to politics, elections, the economy, social issues, etc…it finds its way into sports, TV, movies, music, religion, geography, nationality, vocation…and on and on.  If I tell you that my name is Brian and leave it at that you may think, “Myeh…there’s probably at least 13 or 14 other Brians out there…this one isn’t all that impressive”…or at least my fear is that’s what you’ll think.  It’s a fear we all have, regardless of whether or not you are named Brian.  But if I tell you that my name is Brian and I’m an American, Canadian, Republican, Democrat, Christian, Hindu, Weezer Fan, Days of our Lives watcher, technology freak, musician, veteran, hippy, kung fu master, bi-linguist, professional, social servant…I start to build up clout, in my own eyes and hopefully in yours, too.  I think that’s why we get as fanatical as we do come election time.  “I’m a supporter of _____ candidate.  I will vote yes, no, yes, yes, no on propositions __, __, __, __, __, respectively.”  I’ve suddenly given myself greater worth, importance and value because I’ve tacked some descriptors on to the end of my name.  If my candidate wins, so have I.  Now, I’m not saying that all political beliefs are born out of this thought process…far from it.  All of these areas of belief are important and need to be explored, furthered, voted on, ratified, enacted, followed and believed in…but are they really what I want to define me?  Do I want you to know me as Brian or as a collection of things, beliefs and codes that Brian has signed allegiance to…to support and defend till the bitter end, and even further.  I see the division it
 causes in my own heart and I don’t like it.  I don’t want to make judgments based upon what you eat or which baseball team you root for.  Is it possible to express our hearts apart from aligning ourselves to movements, beliefs and groups?  I have no general answer to this question, but I do know that I need to think long and hard when it comes to what I put in the blank following “Hi, I’m Brian the _____”.  (Maybe I’ll start with “plumber”….that has a nice ring to it.)</p>]]>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you ever stop and listen to your mind when you're not engaged in active thought?  Try it sometime...when you're in the car, sitting at your desk, etc.  I'll catch my mind wandering in strange worlds, thinking inconsequential things, rambling to itself...really weird stuff.  Try it sometime and let me know if I'm alone in this.  The mind is such a powerful thing...where could it go and what could it do if it were being actively guided in these periodic "downtimes"?  I don't want my brain to be on idle...I want a disciplined mind that takes thoughts captive...making them submit!  Where does your mind wander?]]></content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[<p>It’s a love/ha
te relationship, me and ol’ Microsoft.  Goodness knows I’ll never leave her, but sometimes she can be so aggravating!  I could never bring myself to jump ship for the pretty, glitzy, expensive, exclusive (pretentious?) alternative of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theonion.com/content/video/apple_introduces_revolutionary">Apple</a>, but MS could certainly learn a thing or two about clear messaging, marketing and cohesive software and hardware products from their thorn-in-the-side competitor.  So, sold as I am on the idea that Microsoft may one day get it’s act together, I will comfort myself in a bit of griping about the way things otta be in the meantime.  This is going to be a two-part post…the first focusing on some key differences, as I see them, between the two companies, and the second focusing on some of the challenges I’ve had while trying to traverse the wide spectrum of awesome products MS puts out.</p>
<p><u><font size="4">About Me</font></u></p>
<p>First off, I should tell you a little bit about myself.  I see myself as an advanced technology end-user.  I’m not a developer but I can generally navigate myself through the ins and outs of computer-land pretty danged well, if I do say so myself.  As many of you will remember, I felt a strange need to build a small <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/archive/2006/06/22/equipment--the-goods-and-the-bads.aspx">computer</a> and mount it to my motorcycle for a short jaunt up to the Arctic.  Computer guts don’t scare me.</p>

<p align="left">A brief description of my techno-stable: I have a dedicated server machine with a virtual server running my DHCP, etc.  I have a gigabit switch, 802.11n router, Skype phone (actually called the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/support/CIT300">iPhone</a>, ironically enough), network hard drive, and six other computers in my house that get decently routine use for different, unique purposes (four of which I built).  I have two <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/11/att-fuze-is-one.html">Pocket PC’s</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/mp3players/default.htm">Zune</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=144&amp;modelid=14903">digital camera</a> that shoots HD video, a Wii, and and old school Xbox.  I use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mesh.com">Microsoft Live Mesh</a>, Writer, Maps and whatever new free product that comes out…from MS, Google, or anyone else that can put out a good free product.    Writing all of this out shouldn’t be taken as boasting, mind you…more of an admission.  I’m fascinated by technology, probably to a point.  I’m pretty sure that all of the above, though meant to simplify life, has actually had the opposite affect…but I can’t help it, my mind is wired this way.  Ok, enough about me…back to the topic…</p>
<p><u><font size="4">About Apple</font></u></p>
<a title="Product Placement by carotidbattery, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carotidbattery/3208519019/"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 10px 0px 0px; DISPLAY: inline" alt="Product 
Placement" align="left" width="240" height="134" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3424/3208519019_070cb2d020_m.jpg" /></a>
<p>Let’s look at what Apple does right.  Apple sells good, pretty, reliable hardware (albeit at a premium) that just plain works.  They tightly control the software that runs on that hardware which minimizes conflicts and, in turn, keeps thinks working.  Because they make all of their own hardware everything works together exceptionally well.  Files look, sound, open, save and close the same on everything Apple puts out.  And, finally, Apple flat out markets, markets, markets.  Think about it…if you don’t own an iPod, what do you own?  What do you call it?  It’s like people calling soda “Coke”, or facial tissue “Kleenex”.  For all intents and purposes,  iPod = MP3 player and digital media player.  Watch TV or movies?  What kinds of computers and iPods…um, MP3 Players, do you see people using?  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/04/17/washington-post-on-apple-and-product-placement/">It’s</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.applematters.com/article/apples-product-placement/">always</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.edibleapple.com/the-significance-of-apples-product-placement/">Apple</a>…<a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401670.html">always</a>.  It’s not just a product or brand, it’s a symbol.  Oh, you work in graphics, music, video or any other kind of media field?…you have a Mac, right?  Why?  Because Mac’s are better at media applications.  Wait…really?  Ask Average Joe about this and they will be quick to tell you that Macs are indeed better at media applications and slow at telling you what actually makes a Mac better…it just is…everyone knows that.  Mac's may have been better a while back but no longer.  Are the media applications on a Mac easy to use and “sexy”?  Heck yes!  Intuitive, easy and fun to use.  Bingo!  Apple wins.  I mean, come on…their <a target="_blank" href="http://w
ww.flickr.com/photos/neps/sets/72057594138660723/">stores</a> are even pretty! (And I can’t seem to get those catchy iPod commercial <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/ads/">songs</a> out of my head!)  All this isn’t to say that Macs are all looks and no brains or brawn…far from it, they are exceptional machines that can crank out a wonderful, creative product.  But could you put out an equally quality product from a Windows or Linux machine for a much smaller investment?  Of course!…and you would have the freedom to use whatever piece of software you wanted in the process.  Ok, before I spend the entire post talking about Apple, let me get back to Microsoft…</p>
<p><u><font size="4">About Microsoft</font></u></p>
<p><a title="Zune by carotidbattery, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carotidbattery/3209409192/"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 0px 10px; DISPLAY: inline" alt="Zune" align="right" width="136" height="240" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3209409192_2a6630e906_m.jpg" /></a>What does Microsoft do well?  They create great products for developers and advanced users.  They create great products for entry level po’ folks that can’t pony up for an Apple, even though they would really like to.  And, here’s a little secret…they make great products (through third-party companies like Sony, Dell, Gateway, etc.) for everyone else in between.  They even make iPods…um, MP3 players.  They’re called Zunes, and in many <a target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/frankenreview/first-6-takes-on-zune-80-verdict-better-than-ipod-classic-321510.php">reviews</a> they’ve been rated higher than iPods…you didn’t know that?  Strange…  Which gets me to something that Microsoft does extremely poorly.  Marketing…actually, let’s just say communication in general.  They’re the applicant that has an incredible resume that you never end up reading because they have ketchup on their tie and haven’t shaved or showered in a few days…(and the next applicant over looks professiona
l, interesting, exciting and new…who cares what they know or can do…they’re hired!).  Had the average consumer heard of 3G before the iPhone?  I’ve had 3G Windows Mobile devices for quite a few years.  (Again, I’m not bragging about this…just showing how poorly Microsoft and AT&amp;T did with communicating their product and how well Apple did with communicating theirs).  Why does MS have such problems making they’re products sexy…alluring…desirable?  And don’t tell me about the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mojaveexperiment.com/?fbid=0q_Cu75wwqS">Mojave Experiment</a>…sure, it’s clever, but it doesn’t make me want to pop Microsoft headphones in my ears and cruise the New York Metro in my indie-wear.  (Although, as a result of the Mojave Experiment, I now know that I can control my kid’s tv and internet viewing hours…I guess I just need a kid now.)</p>
<p>Alright, so I think this concludes the rant section of my two-part post.  I hope you’ll come back and finish up the rest of it, when it’s posted, as the second part is why I started typing all of this in the first place.  I'm going to get back to noodling around with Windows 7 now...</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah…so my timeliness is a bit lacking.  I mean well, trust me.  Ok, so on to Part 2, a follow-on to my <a href="http://www.carotidbattery.com/archive/2009/01/19/part-1-stop-it-microsoft.-yoursquo
re-confusing-me.aspx">original post</a> which highlighted some of the basic differences between Apple and MS, as I see them.  This post is all about MS, and why they drive me nuts.  It all comes down to communication or, more appropriately, miscommunication: between MS and its consumer and, from an outsider’s perspective, between the different silos internal to the company itself.  Having no real knowledge of the internal workings of the company I can really only make judgments based upon the fruit, that which an end-user such as myself gathers from the base of the MS tree.  So, off we go on my fruit tour…please keep your hands and legs inside the ride at all times.</p>
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/O9fKR80ArOhErzjkCq4Q2A?authkey=Gv1sRgCJ3HhpzLk-2UmQE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img align="left" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_gNb0_qqamzE/SazSAbl9faI/AAAAAAAADWU/A6VVWv9OOvY/s400/Blog%20music.jpg" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline;" alt="" /></a>
<p><font size="3">1.  Windows and My Media</font></p>
<p>On my Dell Laptop (running Win7 Beta), my HP Media Center (running Vista Home Premium) and my hodge-podge desktop (running Windows XP Media Center Edition) I have three Microsoft programs to play my music and videos (Windows Media Player, Windows Media Center, and the Zune Software), and two that will show me my pictures (Media Center and Live Gallery).  Is the integration/consolidation any different between Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7?  Nope.  Now there’s progress…  So where do you buy your digital music?  iTunes, right?  Does your Mom know what iTunes is?  Probably.  Can you name another online music store that’s worth much of anything?  Did you know that you can buy music in the Zune marketplace…even if you don’t own a Zune?  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bhRhDdKnwmcxmju0ROAYmw?authkey=Gv1sRgCJ3HhpzLk-2UmQE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img align="right" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_gNb0_qqamzE/SazUTyUJt0I/AAAAAAAADW0/4qQYyPe-Lz0/s144/Blog%20music2.jpg"
 style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; display: inline;" alt="" /></a>Yeah, I didn’t think so.  Why isn’t there one Microsoft music/video store/player?  Why don’t my Windows Mobile phones have the Zune media player built into them?  (Apparently we’re <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10163257-56.html">getting there</a>.  But why so late?) Why doesn’t Zune record my TV…or why don’t they ditch the Zune moniker and make Windows Media Center the cross-platform media player, store, etc.?  (Oh, by the way, did you know that Windows Media Center can hook up to your TV and Cable and record your TV shows like Tivo or your Cable company’s DVR service…except for free?  Didn’t think so…  Why? because MS hasn’t done a good job of telling you about that.)</p>
<p><font size="3">2.  Interoperability</font><br />
</p>
<p>Hotmail…ugh.  I like where Windows Live is going, but there’s such a disconnect between Hotmail (Live Mail), Outlook, Windows Mobile, <a href="http://www.mesh.com">Mesh</a>, <a href="http://skydrive.live.com">Skydrive</a>, etc.  I get 5GB of storage on Hotmail.  I get 5GB of storage on Mesh.  I get 25GB of storage on Skydrive!  And all for free!  (Did you know that?  Never mind.)  Why isn’t Skydrive just part of Mesh?  Why doesn’t Microsoft just give me 35GB of MS Storage to be used across the board?  My 35GB of pictures and music could be accessible from my Hotmail account and I could attach Powerpoint presentations to my email that came straight from my Mesh account’s Live Desktop.  I could post a blog on my Microsoft Live Spaces Space and pull pictures from my 35GB drive.  And why isn’t Outlook’s functionality spread throughout Mesh, Windows Live Mail, etc?  Why do I have to use things like <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> and <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> just to get the functionality out of my WinMo device that it should already have had right out of the box?</p>
<p><font size="3">3.  Purchasing Points</font></p>
<p>Microsoft Points.  Zu
ne points.  X-box points.  What?  How do I buy them?  Ok…I guess I can figure that out.  Doesn’t really make a ton of sense, but I can deal.  Ok, so now can I buy points for someone else?  I can’t?  Are you serious?  I have to go to a Circuit City or a Best Buy to buy them a gift card and mail it to them?  That’s just plain dumb.  Why can’t I just go onto the Zune Marketplace (or Media Center Marketplace, or Microsoft Jimmy’s Media Bazaar…whatever you want to call it) and buy you some MS points?  You could use them with your Xbox, Zune or whatever else you wanted to.  Nope…can’t do it.  (Dang…where are the stamps again?)</p>

<p><font size="3">4. Mapping and Modeling</font></p>
<p>  <a href="http://photosynth.net/Default.aspx">Photosynth</a>. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/ivm/ICE/">Microsoft ICE</a>.  <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/mapcruncher/">MapCruncher</a>.  Virtual Earth.  Live Maps.  Man, what a great opportunity to totally blow Google and Apple out of the water.  Check out all of the cool stuff you can do with each of these FREE programs.  Amazing, amazing stuff.  I use each of them extensively at work (I’m a Facilities Manager at a K-12 school and I’ve been doing a lot of campus modeling, mapping, etc, lately) and if I weren’t already bald I would have pulled my hair out long ago.  Why don’t these programs interface? Why do I have to hack my way through things to get them to display the stuff I want them to?  Live Maps is better than Google Maps, in its functionality…not its ease of use.  Virtual Earth is incredible, once you get into the SDK and start messing around with things.  Google Earth, however, is fun…and easy to u
se.  I can create custom map layers in MapCruncher that will kinda display how I want them to in Live Maps…sorta.  I can sorta get a Live Maps collection to display on a custom webpage…sorta.  Could a Live Maps/VE programmer get it to work?  Absolutely!  That’s not the point…remember with me what Apple does well?  Oh yeah…  My Mom could make a movie and post it to her own website if she wanted to.</p>
<p>I could keep going here… <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c26efa36-98e0-4ee9-a7c5-98d0592d8c52&amp;DisplayLang=en">Synctoy</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/prophoto/default.aspx">Microsoft Pro Photo</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/ivm/HDView/">Microsoft HD View</a>, <a href="http://office.live.com/">Office Live</a>, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/accountingexpress/FX101729681033.aspx">Office Accounting</a> just to name a few.  All great…all free.  So many incredible products that if they weren’t built in silos and could just interact I wouldn’t have to constantly hack my way through things…outputting a file from one program…inputting it into another…uploading it to one website…emailing it to another.  Until they figure out how to have all things “Microsoft” look, feel, and talk similar I fear the wonderful products they make will only be enjoyed by those with the know-how and patience to work with them.  And really, what choice do I have?  I love the fact that I can build a computer out of a stack of components and load it up with a bunch of free software put out by Microsoft and the thousands and thousands of software developers out there, and mount it to my motorcycle’s gas tank.  (I even considered a Mac Mini, by the way, but there would have been too many software limitations).  But I think I’m probably in the minority here.  Most people, should they have the money to buy shiny and white, are just going to borrow a line from Billy Joel and tell Microsoft to “Keep it to yourself, it’s my <a href="http://www.a
pple.com/ilife/">iLife</a>.”</p>
<p>***UPDATE***  <br />
<br />
So, I saw something about Windows <a href="http://myphone.microsoft.com">MyPhone</a> a few days back and have been playing around with it since…and I gotta say, this is yet another shining example of Microsoft’s apparent silo development strategy. The concept is a good one…it allows you to mirror files (photos, documents, text messages, contacts, tasks and calendar items) that are located on your phone to a website for archiving, viewing, editing and general safe keeping should you drop your phone in the toilet or let your kid play with it…in the toilet.  So, why do I have a problem with this?  A few reasons.  1.  I can already do a good portion of this with Windows Live Mesh.  2.  They’re giving me an abysmal 200MB of storage.  3.  Let me take a breath and crack my knuckles…this is the most frustrating part.  Do a quick search on the following and see what you get:  “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GGLS_enUS312US312&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Windows+Mobile+OTA+sync">Windows Mobile OTA sync</a>”.  The results will show you a couple of things…it will show you that Windows Mobile users have long been clamoring for an ability to sync their contacts, tasks and calendars with Outlook and/or Windows Live over the air (OTA, meaning mobile sync whilst one is out and about and not connected to their home computers).  And it will also show you that because of Microsoft’s unwillingness/inability to provide that capability there is a giganto mass of third-party, cumbersome, partial and/or not-free solutions out there to do this for you.  It shows that MS has too long thought of their WinMo devices as tools of the corporate world while ignoring the large (and growing) group of users who purchased a Windows Mobile device to run their own personal lives or small businesses.  “People don’t need OTA sync capabilities because their companies already have Microsoft Exchange Servers and their phones will sync with them.”  Dumb
.  So, my excitement at MyPhone’s ability to sync my contacts, calendar items and tasks over the air quickly turned to frustration at MS for not simply completing the obvious loop and having those same aforementioned tasks, calendar items and contacts sync straight into Windows Live Mail and/or Office Live.  ArrgggHHGGGHhhgh!!!!  It can’t be that hard!  Seriously!  If MyPhone did nothing besides sync my calendar, tasks and contacts to my Live Account it would be a total victory.  It doesn’t.</p>
<p>Ok, so that’s off my chest.  Nothing left to do but leave you with yet another piece of inspiring MS ad space I saw on the MyPhone site: </p>
<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sBJ-wenS_XXSawuF2DTQEw?authkey=Gv1sRgCJ3HhpzLk-2UmQE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_gNb0_qqamzE/SbDLKq6SFCI/AAAAAAAADYM/pyZXTBA6-Kw/s288/EN_Photograpgy6-1_300x250_A.jpg" style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="" /></a>
<p align="left">Who makes this phone?  Where can I get one?  Wait…do all Windows Mobile 6.1 devices have 5.0MP cameras built into them?  I’ll have to hurry out to a <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/159508/microsoft_plans_stores_hires_dreamworks_exec.html?tk=rel_news">Microsoft Store</a> and buy one…oh, wait…never mind.</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Three years ago today I was spending a relaxing day in West Yellowstone, with Kit, Warren and <a href="http://www.mwmuller.com/">Matt</a>, getting ready for the final push home after spending roughly 35 days and 7,700 miles on the road.  The time has flown by since, and I can’t begin to recount how different my life is now, PMT (Post Motorcycle Trip).  I’m married, for starters.  I have a job that I wasn’t planning on, and have been working there basically since I got back.  I’ve started a business, (mostly) remodeled a house, dealt with the great unknowns of health issues (mine and my wife’s), experienced God’s grace and mercy through friends, family, acquaintances and strangers like you wouldn’t believe and it’s all brought me to…well, today.  And, I’ve found that today is good.  It’s a good place to be.  It seems to be filled with hope, possibility and direction…all three of which I have felt absent over the last few years.  I’m genuinely excited for the next three years…and beyond.</p>
<p>Anyways, I saw something on TV the other day that caught my eye…figured I would pass it on.  I don’t know how many of you are familiar with the History Channel show “Ice Road Truckers”, but it’s a series that was filmed in northern Canada, up until this season.  This season has the truckers riding up and back on the Dalton Highway, the road I (cursed) drove from Fairbanks, AK, up to Deadhorse, and back.  Given the show’s title, I’m sure y
ou can guess that they are not traveling on the road during the summer months, as I was, but it still gives a good idea of the scenery, conditions, etc.  Take a look…it’s brought back some good memories for me. </p>

<p>By the way, Tisha and I just got back from a a pretty decent road-trip this last week…no motocompy this go-round, but we did have a great time and will be posting it about it on our <a href="http://sugarbearandmonkey.com">blog</a>, shortly.  Till next time…</p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>I’ve really been getting into photo-stitching lately.  I’m not sure what it is that draws me to it.  Maybe it’s the fact that I’ve been too many places that left me with the “I can’t fit this all into the viewfinder” feeling.  Case in point…the Grand Canyon.  Either you take a photo from a mile up, you use an expensive rig that includes a lens that can, in fact, fit it all in…or you stitch.  And, lately, I’ve been drawn to the stitches that don’t stitch cleanly.  I like the odd corners and bent photos that the software had to warp in order to include that photo into the overall composite image.  Anyways, here are a few of my stitches from over the years.  I’ve used a variety of programs to accomplish this, but the one I’ve been most impressed with is Microsoft ICE, which ties in nicely with Live Photo Gallery, and right-click menus.  So, here are some of my favorites from the past 10 years or so…each one links to an album with quite a few more. (Depending on your monitor size the photos may be a little ways down the page, due to their width).<br />

Here’s what each one does:</p>  <p>1. <strong><a href="http://www.mesh.com" target="_blank">Live Mesh</a></strong> – In my opinion, Live Mesh is the most capable and promising of the products.  Remote Desktop is great.  Mobile integration is very promising  </p>  <blockquote>   <table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2" width="611"><tbody>       <tr>         <td valign="top" width="295"><strong>Pros:</strong></td>          <td valign="top" width="311"><strong>Cons:</strong></td>       </tr>        <tr>         <td valign="top" width="296">-5GB of online storage</td>          <td valign="top" width="311">-Only 5GB of online storage</td>       </tr>        <tr>         <td valign="top" width="296">-Online Desktop Interface</td>          <td valign="top" width="311">-My experience is that the mobile client seems to crash a <a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/LiveMeshMobile/thread/03ddf509-ae74-45f4-83dc-b785119c2f55" target="_blank">decent</a> <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/content/content.aspx?SiteID=425&amp;ContentID=10010#Live_Mesh_Mobile_Devices_" target="_blank">amount</a></td>       </tr>        <tr>         <td valign="top" width="296">-Syncable files/folders between each device added to mesh</td>          <td valign="top" width="311">-10MB file size limit for mobile client</td>       </tr>        <tr>         <td valign="top" width="296">-Mobile device integration</td>          <td valign="top" width="311"> </td>       </tr>        <tr>         <td valign="top" width="296">-Web-based Remote Desktop</td>          <td valign="top" width="311"> </td>       </tr>        <tr>         <td valign="top" width="296">-Online photo viewer (great, but a bit slow)</td>          <td valign="top" width="311"> </td>       </tr>     </tbody></table> </blockquote>  <p>2. <strong><a href="http://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank">Skydrive</a></strong> – 25GB…free…need I say more?  No…but I will…  </p>  <blockquote>   <table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2" width="613"><tbo

Tasks, but it beats anything MS is offering for my Windows Mobile device.</p>  <p>So, let me just say what I would like to see from MS in the area of file syncing, sharing and backup.  Who knows…maybe this is all in the works already.  I just think the confusion tactics in the meantime aren’t helping.  So, here it is, MS…my wish list:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>-At least 25GB of online storage.      <br />-No less than 4GB/file limit       <br />-Web client with a built-in file viewer, ala Live Mesh but better…with Office Live Workspace integration that allows me to actually view Office files online.  (Think Google Docs, but better)       <br />-Mobile client that allows two-way sync of all photos, video and text messages and syncs my calendar, contacts and tasks with Outlook on my home computer and Office Live.       <br />-Internal, and external syncing and sharing across computers and drives without limitation.  Built-in scheduling.       <br />-Oh, and keep all of the “Pros” from above.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Is that too much to ask?  I’m open to hearing that I’m expecting too much here but I honestly don’t think I am.  Could we even just try to trim this list down to two, more capable products?  Maybe one geared towards the mobile users and one that’s more desktop-centric?  Ok, my monthly MS rant is now done.  I’ll wait expectantly for them to jump all over this…yeah…</p>]]>

				<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear Sir,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I appreciate your enjoyment of the wild, I would ask that you refrain from taking pictures of me and my family.  This is what I was trying tell you when I stood up and stared.  Usually, that has a much more intimidating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a sensitive time for us as we are dealing with the loss of Poppa Bear.  As you probably know, since it's been all over the forest, he left me for some floozy that posed in Bearly Legal.  Then the tramp's cuckolded husband Mr. Chocolate ate Poppa Bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, life has been hard on my family and I ask you to  kindly keep your photographing to your own kind.  And if you need incentive, I have been known to eat paparazzi like yourself before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Momma Bear]]></wp:comment_content>

Look how nice I am while I steal your motorcycle cover."  But French Canadians are the worst people on earth.
