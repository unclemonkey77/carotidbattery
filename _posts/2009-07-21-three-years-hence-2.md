Three years ago today I was spending a relaxing day in West Yellowstone, with Kit, Warren and <a href="http://www.mwmuller.com/">Matt</a>, getting ready for the final push home after spending roughly 35 days and 7,700 miles on the road.  The time has flown by since, and I can’t begin to recount how different my life is now, PMT (Post Motorcycle Trip).  I’m married, for starters.  I have a job that I wasn’t planning on, and have been working there basically since I got back.  I’ve started a business, (mostly) remodeled a house, dealt with the great unknowns of health issues (mine and my wife’s), experienced God’s grace and mercy through friends, family, acquaintances and strangers like you wouldn’t believe and it’s all brought me to…well, today.  And, I’ve found that today is good.  It’s a good place to be.  It seems to be filled with hope, possibility and direction…all three of which I have felt absent over the last few years.  I’m genuinely excited for the next three years…and beyond.</p> <p>Anyways, I saw something on TV the other day that caught my eye…figured I would p ass it on.  I don’t know how many of you are familiar with the History Channel show “Ice Road Truckers”, but it’s a series that was filmed in northern Canada, up until this season.  This season has the truckers riding up and back on the Dalton Highway, the road I (cursed) drove from Fairbanks, AK, up to Deadhorse, and back.  Given the show’s title, I’m sure you can guess that they are not traveling on the road during the summer months, as I was, but it still gives a good idea of the scenery, conditions, etc.  Take a look…it’s brought back some good memories for me.

 By the way, Tisha and I just got back from a a pretty decent road-trip this last week…no motocompy this go-round, but we did have a great time and will be posting it about it on our <a href="http://sugarbearandmonkey.com">blog</a>, shortly.  Till next time…
