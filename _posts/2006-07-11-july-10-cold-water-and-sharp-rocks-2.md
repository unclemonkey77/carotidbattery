I wish I could stay up late and write for a long time, but it&#8217;s already later than I should be up and I have a long ride tomorrow.&#160; Long and short of it is this:&#160; I got to Coldfoot yesterday evening after a long, sometimes harrowing ride through anything and everthing (mud was my favorite), camped there, got up this morning and road (again, through anything and everything) to Deadhorse, AK.&#160; I got a flat tire about 50 miles north of Coldfoot which was no fun.&#160; I had the stuff to patch it, though, and was back on the road in about 20 minutes or so.&#160; Got up here around 4ish and took a tour of the oil fields which ended up at the northern coast, where I took a **quick** swim.&#160; Air temp was 31 with windchill and the water was about 34.&#160; Refreshing.&#160; Anyways, I have so many pictures and photos to share from the last two days but sadly, it must wait.&#160; Today was a good one and it represents the the culmination of&#160; many months of planning and thinking.&#160; I&#8217;m glad you all could share it with me.&#160; I&#8217;ll post more on it later, but for now you can check out some pictures that I put on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/64293054@N00/).&#160; More later.
