We&#8217;re heading up to San Francisco for a Danielson Famile show and my girlfriend&#8217;s birthday. I&#8217;m trying to study for my real estate exam and Jon brought up a previous conversation we had had where I informed him that he was a magma owner. If you own land you technically own it all the way to the center of the earth. Riveting. Ok, typing on my phone is getting old. More later.
