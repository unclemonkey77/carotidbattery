<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carotidbattery/188643482/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/51/188643482\_36d4fcafc8\_t.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="Clean Tread" height="75" width="100" /></a>I rode my bike yesterday&#8230;the first time I&#8217;d ridden since I pulled it into my garage at the end of my trip, over two and a half months ago.  I hadn&#8217;t ridden it since then because I was under the impression (from the dealership in Canada) that the bike would need a valve adjustment when I got back, and also because my garage had grown around the bike, enveloping it in a web of junk.  Well, I cleared up both issues this last week.  The valve adjustment doesn&#8217;t come up for another 8k miles and I hacked the garage&#8217;s overgrowth to free the bike for action.  It took me about a week to finally get the engine to turn over and breathe fire.  She was slow coming to life but seems to be running just fine, now.  It feels good to be back on the bike and it brings back memories of the trip&#8230;good, exciting memories that transcend the morning commuter traffic.<br />
