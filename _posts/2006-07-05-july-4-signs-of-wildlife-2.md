It&#8217;s after midnight and the last two days have been longs ones.&#160; 859 miles long, to be exact.&#160; Anyways, I rolled in to Smithers, BC today after riding for over 12 hours and almost 500 miles and after a short look for campsites I gave in and got a room.&#160; The one campsite I found was actually pretty nice, but as soon as I found out that it didn&#8217;t have a shower, I nixed it and moved on.&#160; Anyways, I really need sleep so I&#8217;ll slap a few pictures on here and then I&#8217;ll write more later on.&#160; So here they are: an action shot, bugs, and some fun signs.

I saw signs warning me of deer, elk, moose, and longhorn sheep&#8230;I saw none of them. I _did_ see a little black bear running through a field and a momma duck with her three ducklings waiting patiently at the side of the road for it to be clear so she could cross.&#160; The bear didn&#8217;t eat me, nor did it make an attempt at eating me&#8230;so my first bear encounter of the trip went well.&#160; The duck was a bit more aggressive.&#160; I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.&#160; Oh, and that Microsoft interview thing was cool.&#160; It will be online in about two weeks and I&#8217;ll make sure you all get the word.&#160; More on that later on.&#160; Must&#8230;.sleep&#8230;
