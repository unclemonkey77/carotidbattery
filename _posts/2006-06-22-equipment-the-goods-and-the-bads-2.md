Today proved challenging for me.&#160; I decided to take motocompy out for a spin to make sure everything was working well before the long trip tomorrow.&#160; I&#8217;ve done a lot of work on the system in the last few days, with the help of my brother, Jon, and I wanted to make sure it was ready to go and there were no nasty surprises as I was leaving.&#160; I took motocompy out to the bike, set him down, turned him on, started using things&#8230;started _trying_ to use things&#8230;and found that things weren&#8217;t usable.&#160; My touchscreen, which had worked so well since I had purchased it in November, had chosen the afternoon before my departure to go cold to my touch.&#160; Long story and I&#8217;m not really even sure what all happened&#8230;it was a flurry of driver installs, driver uninstalls, driver reinstalls, system reboots, etc.&#160; Somewhere along the line it decided to work again and as of now I have a working computer with a working touchscreen.&#160; We&#8217;ll see how long that lasts.&#160; So, while on the subject of system components (both working and non-working), I might as well list out some info about the bike, the computer, and what kind of programs I&#8217;m running.&#160; If you&#8217;re not into the technical stuff then you can just skip to the video at the bottom.&#160; I filmed it tonight on a quick trip to ensure the computer was working properly.&#160; Here goes&#8230;
