<img title="pompeii" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rotation-of-2004-12-05-070.jpg" alt="Rotation of 2004-12-05 070.JPG" width="108" height="144" align="left" border="1" hspace="20" />My brother, Keith, and his family lived in Naples for a few years and I had the opportunity to visit them a little over a year ago.  Naples actually spreads up the slopes of Vesuvius, which is crazy because an eruption of Pompeii proportions (or worse) is nearly inevitable, according to this [article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4780916.stm).  Visiting Pompeii was one of the highlites of the trip, but it provides a frightening look at what an eruption can do, and sadly, probably will do again.
