Not that we need any more thoughts from the unqualiffied on the current pandemic, but I thought this might help some out there and so I'll offer my two cents to the wind.
      
I'm 42.  I lead a fairly normal middle-aged, middle-class lifestyle and I'm struggling through what many of you reading this also are.  Dwindling incomes and mounting uncertainty are common sources of anxiety in my house, as I'm sure they are in many of yours.  I read the news and I see the recommendations, and I try to balance those against common sense and my family's needs, and it's a difficult balance.  I want this to end and I want to be able to go back to work, make money, pay bills, etc.

The unique complication I face is that, while my age doesn't seem to put me in the corona-crosshairs, my medical history and current reality does.  I have a rare autoimmune, vascular disease that requires me to be on immunosupressants.  My lungs and kidneys have both been damaged by the disease and sometimes I struggle to get a full breath.
