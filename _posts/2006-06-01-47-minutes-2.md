<img src="http://carotidbattery.com/images/carotidbattery_com/ship.jpg" alt="ship.jpg" align="left" border="1" height="76" hspace="10" width="102" />That&#8217;s the amount of time I have left as a member of our Active Duty Military.  Today was my last day at work, but the Navy owns you 24-7, for good and for bad, so I&#8217;m not out until it&#8217;s no longer today.  A lot of people asked me if I was super happy to be done&#8230;which is an interesting question.  Yes, I&#8217;m very happy to be done.  I&#8217;m very happy to be able to pursue something new and different.  I&#8217;m happy to be able to grow out my remaining hair and measly facial growth.  (37 minutes now).  Yes, it&#8217;s time to be done and I have many things I&#8217;m looking forward to.  It&#8217;s strange, though, because had you asked me if I was happy to be getting out of the Navy two years ago when I was leaving the ship I would have gone into great detail in describing how ready I was to be done with the Navy and how much I couldn&#8217;t wait to put that par t of my life behind me.  Two years of working behind a desk and in front of a classroom have tempered my readiness and now it just feels like the completion of the inevitable rather than a much yearned after freedom.  I went to work this morning a little earlier than i have been, cleaned up my desk, filed some reports, said my goodbyes and walked out to my car.  I have to confess that i teared up a bit as I left the building, not because I was sad to go but because it represented a monumental shift in my life and I started to feel the gravity of that.  Yeah, I know, I probably should have felt that coming a little while before I was leaving the building, but there&#8217;s just something about walking out a door and looking back on a place you <i>used</i> to work that makes you also start to think about where your life was, is and is going&#8230;everything that&#8217;s brought you to now and made you what you are.  Those are big thoughts and they got the best of me.  Ok, well I&#8217;ve got 19 minutes left until I&#8217;m done so I figure I might as well stay up and bring in my own personal new year.  Here&#8217;s to new beginnings.<br />
