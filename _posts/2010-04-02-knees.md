I found out this morning that I have a torn meniscus. Not a huge deal, really, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be able to get it fixed pretty easily. After getting the call from the doctor with the results of the MRI, I took a look online at what a meniscus actually is and found this picture.  I can&#8217;t look at this without thinking of how amazing it is that a knee actually works&#8230;I mean, look at all of that?  And that&#8217;s just one joint&#8230;I have 229 others.  Fearful and wonderful&#8230;that&#8217;s how I got put together.
