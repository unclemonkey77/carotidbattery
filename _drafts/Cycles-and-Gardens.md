I came to the realization this last week that I have a dominant leg.  I&#8217;ve had my suspicions for a little while now, but after reading an <a title="Balance Training" href="http://velonews.competitor.com/2008/05/coaches-panel/balance-training-is-key-for-injury-free-bicycle-racing_76813" target="_blank">article</a> on the subject I can now say for certain that my left leg dominates, which is odd because I am right handed.  I found myself curling the tows on my right foot and bowing my leg out a little bit when climbing hills&#8230;both not the best for applying good, consistent and sustained force to a pedal.  I started to notice this a few weeks back and, ever since, have fought with myself to correct it.  I will make notice of what I&#8217;m doing, correct it, cycle for 30 seconds, 5 minutes, more&#8230;and find myself right back to curling my toes and letting my left leg do all the hard work.  If you are a cyclist then this is all probably old news to you, but as a neophyte to cycling this came as a surprise. This purpose of this post isn&#8217;t to discuss the finer points of cycling mechanics, and my introductory paragraph may have been enough to cause some to already check out.  As I have been dealing with this imbalance in my cycling I began to think of all of the other areas of my life where this type of imbalance exists.
