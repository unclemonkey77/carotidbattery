I&#8217;ve been realizing as of late that I pray like I email.  I&#8217;ve come to this realization as my <a title="Flood Church" href="http://www.diveintoflood.com/" target="_blank">church </a>has been doing a series on prayer and the marrieds group we&#8217;re a part of has been following along with it.  As part of that we have been talking and praying together about what prayer should really look, sound and feel like.  As we were praying last Wednesday I became somewhat frustrated with a recurring theme in my prayer life&#8230;the sense that my prayer is very impersonal.  As I was thinking about it I had this image pop into my head of a letter being sent up to God and I immediately thought &#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8230;I pray like I&#8217;m sending a letter to God!&#8221;  We finished the prayer and I brought up the idea to the others in my group&#8230;it seemed to resonate with several others, too.  This thought has stuck with me and I&#8217;ve been mulling it over ever since.

When I email someone I try to convey, as accurately and succinctly as possible, what it is I&#8217;m trying to say in the hopes that they will get my message loud and clear and then be able to respond appropriately.  That way it shouldn&#8217;t take them long&#8230;after all, I&#8217;m a pretty logical person and I&#8217;ve already given them all the facts.  Oftentimes I choose the medium of email specifically because I get to control the conversation.  I am able to put everything that&#8217;s on my mind into writing without the &#8220;burden&#8221; of allowing the other person the opportunity to interrupt and respond.  Essentially, it&#8217;s convenient because I don&#8217;t have to stop and really listen.  After I send the email I wait&#8230;I may think back through what I had to say, justifying my rationale and bolstering my position.  I prepare for the response, trying to anticpate what it will be&#8230;what it should be.  Email can be very impersonal this way&#8230;a means of doing transactional business with as little human interaction as possible.

When I pray, I find myself going through what it is I want to say to God several times, as if trying to refine the prayer so that the message God gets is loud and clear.  By the time I give him the final version, it&#8217;s usually devoid of any heart&#8230;it&#8217;s as though I have transcribed a prayer for someone else and I am merely presenting it to God on their behalf.

Is this the kind of prayer God wants?

Who has created this formal relationship?

Imagine being with God, in person&#8230;would I still communicate with him this way?
