Roasted coffee today.  Nicaragua Limoncillo Pacamara Dry-Process from <a title="Sweet Maria's" href="http://www.sweetmarias.com/" target="_blank">Sweet Maria’s</a> was the bean of the day.  The description reads as follows: “A very exotic cup, a true fruit bomb coffee.  Intense fruit and chocolate flavors, papaya, fruit punch, dried apricot, tobacco, brandy, bittersweet, low acidity.”  A true fruit bomb, indeed.  It’s a very interesting flavor and I really like it.  Very different from the Honduran beans that I roasted a few weeks back.  Anyways, here are some pictures/videos from the two adventures in roasting.  Looking forward to more.
