I loved my Grandpa and no one would have to tell me he was a good man.  What no one seemed to know the full extent of, though, was that my Grandpa was a true humble hero.  He had served in WWII&#8230;enlisting in the Coast Guard (because he was too short for the Marine Corps) and serving aboard a Navy ship as the coxswain of the landing craft that brought the troops ashore in North Africa and the Pacific.  His actions garnered him a meritorious promotion, which is obviously commendable in and of itself.  What no one seemed to know, however, is that he had been awarded the <a title="Bronze Star Medal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Star_Medal" target="_blank">Bronze Star Medal</a> (the fourth highest combat award) as a 2nd or 3rd Class Petty Officer.  My military friends will appreciate the rarity of an award like that being awarded to so junior a sailor.  To put it in perspective, when the ship I was on engaged in offensive missile strikes against Afghanistan in 2001 the ship&#8217;s captain, a Navy Commander, was awarded the Bronze Star.  Grandpa was about 10 ranks below Commander .  I&#8217;m not sure what the award was given for and, while I would like to know, I don&#8217;t think it matters too terribly much&#8230;I am most impressed by my Grandpa&#8217;s humility.  As the minister at the service pointed out yesterday, my Grandpa was truly part of the greatest generation&#8230;a man who loved his country and family and always had a strong sense of duty.

I would encourage each of you reading this to take a moment to call your grandparents and/or parents&#8230;aunts and uncles&#8230;family.  We all said yesterday how much we wished it wouldn&#8217;t take a death in the family to bring us all back together.  Life is busy, to be sure, but the eternal souls God puts around us for the few, quick years we have on this planet are worth more than we will probably ever comprehend.  I encourage you&#8230;myself&#8230;to remember that in the midst of the busyness.

Love you, Grandpa.  Fair winds and following seas&#8230;
