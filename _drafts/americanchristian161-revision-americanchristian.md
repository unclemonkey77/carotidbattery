I&#8217;ve been reading (listening to, actually) John Piper&#8217;s [&#8220;Don&#8217;t Waste Your Life&#8221;](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Waste-Your-Life-Piper/dp/1433506327/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1292825322&sr=8-1) and it has served to further solidify the following thought in my mind: to be a &#8220;good&#8221; Christian means to be a &#8220;bad&#8221; American, and vice versa.  This is not a resignation, nor is it a novel idea, but I think much of the modern American church still conflates the two, that to be a good American means to be a good Christian and, much more dangerously, to be a good Christian means to be a good American.  But, really, aside from our nation&#8217;s settlers being a group that arrived here seeking religious freedom, and our founding fathers largely being a group that identified with Christianity, our nation was built upon freedom and liberty, not faith in Christ.  That faith may have been the undertone or the taken-for-granted understanding upon which the Constitution was built, but the resulting document allowed for a nation that would, one day, choose to exercise its freedoms and not identify itself with any one faith, let alone Christianity.  And this is exactly what we have collectively done.

So, which are you?  Which am I?  Am I an American Christian or am I a Christian that happens to live in America?  Which holds more sway upon my life&#8230;my American citizenship or my citizenship in the Kingdom of God?  These two states of citizenship have come to the point where they are fundamentally at odds.  I&#8217;m not talking about all of the things that Christians known for being &#8220;anti&#8221; (homosexuality, pornography, abortion, etc.)&#8230;I&#8217;m talking about the fundamentals of individualism, commercialism,  materialism&#8230;comfort, safety, significance.  If I am a good American Christian, I seek comfort and notoriety in the name of Christ.  I take care of my family, save for retirement, I don&#8217;t fool around, I tithe
