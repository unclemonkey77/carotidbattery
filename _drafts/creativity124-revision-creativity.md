Sometimes I think that I’m creative but just don’t have the time or resources to adequately express my creativity.  But then, upon having that thought, I wonder if, simply by virtue of me thinking that, it means I’m really not that creative after all.  I mean, most of the “creative” people I know have only been able to express their creativity through hard work, sacrifice, at all odds, without proper resources, and by simply grinning and bearing it…because they’re creativity would not settle for anything less than full expression.  Does being “creative” necessarily entail the need/desire/ to express said creativity?  Is the fact that I’m thinking this much about it mean that I’m way too analytical to be truly creative?  Ok…I need to stop…
