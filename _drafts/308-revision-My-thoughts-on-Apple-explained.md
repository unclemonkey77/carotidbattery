I know people won&#8217;t like me for making this comment, but since you all already think I&#8217;m anti-Apple, all the time, it&#8217;s probably not going to surprise anyone.  The new Mac Pro.  Beautiful.  Ridiculously high performance.  Ridiculously small size.  And in two years when you want to upgrade it, you won&#8217;t be able to.  This type of philosophy is nothing new to Apple (non-replaceable batteries in iPods/iPhones, non-upgradeable anything in Mac Air, pain-in-the butt upgrades in everything else) and while you could just say &#8220;who cares&#8230;don&#8217;t buy it if you don&#8217;t like it&#8221;, consider the implications of purchasing along these lines.  It would be like buying a car that has a hood that you physically cannot open on your own.  When the battery dies on this new car, what are your options?  You can take it back to the manufacturer, assuming the manufacturer will still work on it.  (Yeah, there are products that Apple will refuse to work on anymore.) You can probably find someone who will replace your battery but their shop is going to be extremely pricey because, well, it can be.  But if you don&#8217;t want to go through that, then what&#8217;s your next easiest option&#8230;you buy a new car.  Was the old car totaled?  Was it complete junk?  No, it just had a bad battery.
