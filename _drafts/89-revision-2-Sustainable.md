**What makes you green makes you green.** &#8211; those that know me know that I am all about efficiency, process, improvement, analysis and frugality&#8230;not to be confused with cheap, but pretty close. I&#8217;ve been this way ever since I can remember. I don&#8217;t know if it was being the fifth of five boys and ending up with a lot of second-hand stuff or if I was just hard-wired to be this way regardless, but I can always remember a strong desire to integrate different things into something better and more functional than the sum of its parts.Â  Yes, Transformers struck a chord with me&#8230;especially this guy.
