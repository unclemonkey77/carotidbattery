I&#8217;m not a big fan of Apple. That&#8217;s probably not a surprise to most people that know me, but I probably haven&#8217;t done well in explaining myself&#8230;and maybe I haven&#8217;t even put enough thought into it to really be able to give a good explanation. Two things have helped to bring this to the forefront of my mind recently, however: 1. A client requested an upgraded hard drive and some replacement fans in his MacBook Pro (not at the same time, unfortunately), and 2. I just watched a review on the new Mac Pro. These two things have helped me to think through what it is exactly that irks me when it comes to how Apple does business, the kinds of products it makes, how those products are received, how those products are used and replaced, and what effect this has on our modern-day society and here is my conclusion: Apple is bad for us.

Before you laugh and call me silly, dumb or worse, let me explain.

To sum the new Mac Pro upBeautiful.  Ridiculously high performance.  Ridiculously small size.  And in two years when you want to upgrade it, you won&#8217;t be able to.  This type of philosophy is nothing new to Apple (non-replaceable batteries in iPods/iPhones, non-upgradeable anything in Mac Air, pain-in-the butt upgrades in everything else) and while you could just say &#8220;who cares&#8230;don&#8217;t buy it if you don&#8217;t like it&#8221;, consider the implications of purchasing along these lines.  It would be like buying a car that has a hood that you physically cannot open on your own.  When the battery dies on this new car, what are your options?  You can take it back to the manufacturer, assuming the manufacturer will still work on it.  (Yeah, there are products that Apple will refuse to work on anymore.) You can probably find someone who will replace your battery but their shop is going to be extremely pricey because, well, it can be.  But if you don&#8217;t want to go through that, then what&#8217;s your next easiest option&#8230;you buy a new car.  Was the old car totaled?  Was it complete junk?  No, it just had a bad battery.
