I&#8217;ve been realizing as of late that I pray like I email.  I&#8217;ve come to this realization as my <a title="Flood Church" href="http://www.diveintoflood.com/" target="_blank">church </a>has been doing a series on prayer and the marrieds group we&#8217;re in has been following along with it.  As part of that we have been talking and praying together about what prayer should really be like.  As we were praying last Wednesday I became somewhat frustrated with a recurring theme in my prayer life&#8230;the sense that my prayer is very impersonal.  As I was thinking about it I had this image pop into my head of a letter being sent up to God and I immediately thought &#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8230;I pray like I&#8217;m sending a letter to God!&#8221;  We finished the prayer and I brought up the idea to the others in my group&#8230;seemed to resonate with several others, too.

This thought has stuck with me and I&#8217;ve been mulling it over ever since.  When I email someone I try to convey, as accurately and succinctly as possible, what it is I&#8217;m trying to say in the hopes that they will get my message loud and clear and then be able to respond appropriately, because I&#8217;ve given them all the facts.  Oftentimes I choose the medium of email specifically because I get to control the communication.  I am able to get everything that&#8217;s on my mind in writing without the &#8220;burden&#8221; of allowing the other person the opportunity to interrupt and respond.  Essentially, it&#8217;s convenient because I don&#8217;t have to stop and really listen.  After I send the email I wait&#8230;I may think back through what I had to say, justifying my rationale and bolstering my position.  I prepare for the response, trying to anticpate what it will be&#8230;what it should be.  Email can be very impersonal this way&#8230;a means of doing transactional business with as little human interaction as possible.

When I pray, I find myself going through it several times, as if trying to refine the prayer so that the message God gets is loud and clear.  By the time I give him the final version, it&#8217;s usually devoid of any heart&#8230;it&#8217;s as though I have transcribed a prayer for someone else and I am merely presenting it to God on their behalf.

Is this the kind of prayer God wants?

Who has created this formal relationship?

Imagine being with God, in person&#8230;would I still communicate with him this way?
