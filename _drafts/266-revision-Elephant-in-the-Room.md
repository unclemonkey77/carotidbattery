Had a fun thought last night as I was brushing my teath and getting ready for bed.  We are all blind men and God is the [elephant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant).  There I am with my hand on one of his arm hairs, thinking that I can describe him in some moderate level of detail.  As I was thinking about this it made me realize a few things:

&#8211; The person next to me, with their hand on another one of the arm hairs, has a unique experience of God.  No less valid, no more accurate than mine&#8230;just as limited.  
&#8211; God&#8217;s identity does not lie in our collective comprehension of him.  He is not relative, nor is his truth.  He is consistent.  
&#8211; I think some people get their hands around several of the arm hairs, and end up with a more complete idea of God.  They may fall well short of a full comprehension, but they are [worth listening to](http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/11-1.htm) as they seek to understand more fully.  
&#8211; God wants us to seek him&#8230;to know more and more of him.  He does not desire confusion.  He speaks!  He doesn&#8217;t sit idly by while we struggle to understand and describe him.  He tells us about himself!  He is generous with giving understanding to those who seek with all their heart.  
&#8211; Understanding comes from him.  Ability to communicate that understanding to others comes from him.  
&#8211; We CAN know him! How incredible is it that he allows and desires that?

Anyways&#8230;these are still just a bunch of thoughts taking shape in my head, but I&#8217;m enjoying thinking through the imagery.  What do you all think?

(Side note&#8230;here&#8217;s an interesting, similar [article](http://www.ethosapologetics.com/elephant-theology/).  It&#8217;s approaching the blind men &#8211; elephant tale from the perspective of absolute truth rather than understanding God, himself, but it brings up some interesting thoughts.)
