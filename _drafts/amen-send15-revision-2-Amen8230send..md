I&#8217;ve been realizing as of late that I pray like I email.  I&#8217;ve come to this realization fairly recently, as my church has been doing a series on prayer and the marrieds group has been following along with it.  As part of that we have been talking and praying together about what prayer should really be like.  As we were praying last Wednesday I became somewhat frustrated with a recurring theme in my prayer life&#8230;the sense that my prayer is very impersonal.  As I was thinking about it I had this image pop into my head of a letter being sent up to God and I immediately thought &#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8230;I pray like I&#8217;m sending a letter to God!&#8221;  When I email I try to convey, as accurately and succinctly as possible, what it is I&#8217;m trying to say.
