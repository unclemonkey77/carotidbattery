I&#8217;ve been realizing as of late that I pray like I email.  I&#8217;ve come to this realization as my <a title="Flood Church" href="http://www.diveintoflood.com/" target="_blank">church </a>has been doing a series on prayer and the marrieds group we&#8217;re in has been following along with it.  As part of that we have been talking and praying together about what prayer should really be like.  As we were praying last Wednesday I became somewhat frustrated with a recurring theme in my prayer life&#8230;the sense that my prayer is very impersonal.  As I was thinking about it I had this image pop into my head of a letter being sent up to God and I immediately thought &#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8230;I pray like I&#8217;m sending a letter to God!&#8221;  We finished the prayer and I brought up the idea to the others in my group&#8230;seemed to resonate with several others, too.

This thought has stuck with me and I&#8217;ve been mulling it over this past week.  When I email I try to convey, as accurately and succinctly as possible, what it is I&#8217;m trying to say.
