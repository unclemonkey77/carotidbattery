<p style="text-align: left;">
  The wife and I made a trip up to <a href="http://www.soledadmemorial.com/">Mt. Soledad</a> to take a look out east at the <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/feb/28/nasa-satellite-photographs-san-diego-county-snowfa/">SoCal snow</a> we got here in San Diego this last weekend.  I took my trusty (although showing its age), <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/digital_cameras/other_powershot/powershot_tx1">Canon TX1</a>, to see if I could get some good panorama shots, including both snow and surf.  The one linked to below is the granddaddy of my stitches to date, I think.  I&#8217;ve taken some with more total photos, but I&#8217;m really digging this one.  This is made up of 18 shots, edited a bit in Picasa to bring out the colors and contrast, stitched together in Microsoft ICE and then exported to Microsoft&#8217;s HD View&#8230;all free products.  I took another set, looking north, that has 19 shots in it, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s as visually interesting.  Having the islands, the coast, Mission Bay, San Diego Bay, the Coronado Bridge, downtown San Diego,  snow-capped mountains, and even a glimpse into Mexico, in a single photo is pretty danged cool.  Hope you like!
