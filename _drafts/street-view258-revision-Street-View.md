Someone asked me about the motorcycle trip recently.  Long story short&#8230;I&#8217;ve been putting a little time into cleaning up the old, busted website (<a href="old.carotidbattery.com" target="_blank">old.carotidbattery.com</a>) which has sent me on a trip down memory lane.    Out of curiosity, I checked Google Maps to see if the beginning of the Dalton Highway was on Street View.  Turns out the entire highway is on there!  So, if you want to see what the highway was like, check it out!
